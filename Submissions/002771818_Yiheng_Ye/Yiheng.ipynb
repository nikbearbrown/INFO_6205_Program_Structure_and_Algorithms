    "Answer: For any set of players and their ratings for specific positions, there may not always exist a stable pair of strategies.\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "Consider a scenario where Team X and Team Y have players with distinct ratings for various positions. Let's assume that the players have the following ratings for their respective positions:\n",

    "Player X to Position 1\n",
    "Player Y to Position 2\n",
    "Player Z to Position 3\n",
    "In this scenario, the pair of strategies (S, T) is not stable because Team X can unilaterally change its strategy to win more games. \n",
    "If Team X swaps Player A and Player B's positions so that Player B goes to Position 1 and Player A to Position 2, they will win more games against Team Y's strategy T.\n",
    "Similarly, Team Y can also change its strategy to win more games against Team X's strategy S. This demonstrates that the pair of schedules (S, T) is not stable.\n",

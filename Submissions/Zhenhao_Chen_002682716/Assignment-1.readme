Assignment-1 : Reflection of assignment 1 

How ChatGPT or the tool you used assisted in this task:
I used ChatGPT to assist me in this task. It's really a cool tool for us to create something and learn something. When I have confusion about the sample questions, ChatGPT could provide me explanations. And it produced a typical Gale-Shapley problem for me which I think the process I solved this problem can greatly enhance my understanding to this algorithm.

Challenges you faced while ensuring the problem maintained the spirit of the example:
It's not difficult to ensure the problem maintained the spirit of the example since it's a very typical Gale-Shapley problem. When I saw the problem, I can realize it ask me to find a stable marriage for males and females.

What you learned about problem design in the realm of algorithms:
- The most important thing that I've learned is that a well-designed algorithmic problem is clear and precisely defined. Ambiguity can lead to confusion and difficulties in understanding the problem's requirements. Therefore, it's of great essential to provide a clear and unambiguous problem statement.
- Moreover, it's also helpful to provide clear sample input and output since they clarify the problem's requirements.

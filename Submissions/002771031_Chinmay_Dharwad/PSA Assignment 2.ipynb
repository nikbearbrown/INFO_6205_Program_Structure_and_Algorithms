    "1. **Algorithm for Topological Sorting**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Input**:\n",
    "    - V: Set of vertices in the graph.\n",
    "    - E: Set of directed edges in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Output**:\n",
    "    - List containing the topological order of the vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Algorithm Steps**:\n",
    "    - Initialize an empty list to store the topological order.\n",
    "    - Calculate the in-degree of each vertex.\n",
    "    - Enqueue all vertices with in-degree 0.\n",
    "    - While the queue is not empty:\n",
    "        - Dequeue a vertex V.\n",

    "            - If in-degree of u becomes 0, enqueue u.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Handling Cycles**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   If the graph \\(G\\) contains cycles, the topological sorting algorithm will not terminate or provide a valid topological ordering. When a cycle is encountered, the algorithm will not find any vertices with in-degree 0, resulting in an infinite loop. This is because cycles create dependencies that prevent the algorithm from removing vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "   To handle graphs with cycles, we can introduce a cycle detection mechanism before executing the topological sorting algorithm. If a cycle is detected, we can either terminate the process and report that the graph is not a directed acyclic graph (DAG), or we can break the cycle by removing edges to make it a DAG. In either case, the original algorithm for topological sorting may not be directly applicable, and modifications are needed to handle graphs with cycles.\n",

In the process of completing this assignment, I learnt several key concepts related to which I would like to mention here. Through various tasks and questions, I gained a deeper understanding of the following topics:

**Graph Theory:**
 Graphs are mathematical structures that consist of vertices (nodes) and edges (links). Vertex-disjoint cycle-covers are a type of graph covering, where the goal is to cover all vertices of the graph using a set of
 cycles that do not share any vertices.

 **NP-Completeness:**
 + NP-completeness is a classification of problems in computational complexity theory. A problem is said to be in NP if its solutions can be verified efficiently (in polynomial time) by a deterministic Turing machine, but it is unknown whether they can be found efficiently (in polynomial time) by a deterministic Turing machine.
 + No efficient algorithm has been found for any NP-complete problem, and it is widely believed that no such algorithm exists. However, efficient algorithms exist for verifying solutions to NP-complete problems.

 **Hamiltonian Path and Cycle:**
 + In graph theory, a Hamiltonian path is a path in a graph that visits each vertex exactly once. A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle in a graph that visits each vertex exactly once.
 + The Hamiltonian path problem is the problem of determining whether a given directed or undirected graph has a Hamiltonian path. The Hamiltonian cycle problem is the problem of determining whether a given directed or undirected graph has a Hamiltonian cycle.

 **Vertex-Disjoint Cycle-Cover Problem:**
 + The vertex-disjoint cycle-cover problem is a generalization of the Hamiltonian path and cycle problems. In this problem, the goal is to find a set of cycles in a graph that cover all vertices of the graph, such that no two cycles share any vertices.

**Directed Hamiltonian Cycle Problem:**
+ The Directed Hamiltonian Cycle Problem is the problem of determining whether a given directed graph has a Hamiltonian cycle.

**Directed Disjoint Cycles Problem:**
+ The Directed Disjoint Cycles Problem involves determining whether there exist k disjoint cycles in a directed graph such that each cycle contains one of k given nodes.

**NP-hardness:**
+ A problem is said to be NP-hard if any problem in NP can be reduced to it in polynomial time.

**Constraint-Based Selection:**
+ Leveraged the concept of selecting a subset of speakers under constraints, akin to choosing a limited number of musicians for an orchestra ensemble.

**Efficient Subset Selection:**
+ Learned to strategically select subsets by balancing criteria fulfillment and constraint limitations, similar to the challenge of forming an efficient orchestra ensemble.

**Bipartite Matching:**
+ A technique for matching pairs of nodes in a bipartite graph, ensuring that no two nodes in the same set are matched.

    "**Q8 (10 Points)<br>\n",
    "Two chess players, Alice and Bob, are preparing for a chess tournament. Each player has a set of chess pieces, and each chess piece has its own strength on the chessboard. Alice wants to devise a strategy (Assignment A), and Bob wants to devise his strategy (Assignment B) to maximize their chances of winning the tournament.<br>**\n",
    "**Each chess piece has a fixed strength value based on its performance in previous tournaments, and no two pieces share the same strength value. Both players aim to win as many games as possible during the tournament to secure the championship.<br>\n",
    "The rules of the tournament are as follows: In each game, Alice and Bob will choose one of their chess pieces to play against each other. The player with the stronger chess piece wins the game. If both pieces have the same strength, the game ends in a draw.<br>**\n",
    "**Suppose, in the opening round of the chess tournament, Alice reveals her strategy (Assignment A), and Bob reveals his strategy (Assignment B). Based on this pair of strategies, each player wins certain games, following the rule mentioned above. We'll say that the pair of strategies (Assignment A, Assignment B) is stable if neither Alice nor Bob can unilaterally change their strategy to win more games. In other words, there is no alternative strategy Assignment A' for Alice, and no alternative strategy Assignment B' for Bob, such that they can win more games with the pair (Assignment A', Assignment B) or (Assignment A, Assignment B') than they did with the original pair (Assignment A, Assignment B).<br>\n",
    "Your task is to determine whether, for any set of chess pieces and their strength values, there exists a stable pair of strategies for Alice and Bob.<br>\n",
    "Resolve this question by doing one of the following two things:<br>**\n",
    "**1.\tGive an algorithm that, for any set of chess pieces and their strength values, produces a stable pair of strategies (Assignment A, Assignment B).<br>\n",
    "OR<br>\n",
    "2.\tGive an example of a set of chess pieces and associated strength values for which there is no stable pair of strategies (Assignment A, Assignment B).**\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Solution</u>:\n",
    "\n",
    "For certain sets of chess piece strengths and strategies, a stable pair may exist, while in other cases, it may not. The stability of the pair depends on the interplay between chess piece strengths and player strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario 1: Stable Pair Exists (Algorithm)\n",
    "\n",
    "To find a stable pair of strategies for Alice and Bob for any set of chess pieces and their strength values, we can employ a modified version of the Gale-Shapley algorithm, often used for stable matching problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign each chess piece to both Alice and Bob based on their respective strength values. This creates initial preference lists for both players.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iteratively execute the following steps:\n",
    "a. Alice proposes to the chess piece in her preference list with the highest strength.<br>\n",
    "b. That chess piece either accepts Alice's proposal or rejects it in favor of Bob if Bob's current assignment has higher strength.<br>\n",
    "c. Bob updates his preference list, moving the rejected chess piece down his list.<br>\n",
    "d. Repeat steps a-c until each chess piece is assigned to either Alice or Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all chess pieces are assigned, the resulting pair of strategies (Assignment A, Assignment B) is stable if neither Alice nor Bob can unilaterally change their strategy to win more games. This stability is achieved because the assignments are made based on the chess pieces' strengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario 2: Stable Pair Does Not Exist (Example)\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate that a stable pair of strategies may not always exist, consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice has three chess pieces with strengths [3, 4, 5].<br>\n",
    "Bob has three chess pieces with strengths [5, 4, 3].<br>\n",
    "If Alice uses Assignment A to choose her pieces in ascending order of strength ([3, 4, 5]), and Bob uses Assignment B to choose his pieces in descending order of strength ([5, 4, 3]), they have a stable pair of strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if Alice and Bob both choose their pieces in ascending order of strength ([3, 4, 5] for Alice, and [3, 4, 5] for Bob), a stable pair of strategies no longer exists. In this case, Bob can unilaterally change his strategy to choose his pieces in descending order ([5, 4, 3]), winning more games than with the original pair of strategies."

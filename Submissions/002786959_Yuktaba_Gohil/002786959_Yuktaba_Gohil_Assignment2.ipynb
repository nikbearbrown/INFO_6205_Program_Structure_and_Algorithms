You want to develop a quick way to find out if a specific sequence of words appears as a subsequence within a longer literary work. Given a lengthy text from a novel, represented as a string text, and a sequence of words, represented as an array of strings sequence, devise an algorithm that can efficiently determine if the sequence of words appears in the text as a subsequence.

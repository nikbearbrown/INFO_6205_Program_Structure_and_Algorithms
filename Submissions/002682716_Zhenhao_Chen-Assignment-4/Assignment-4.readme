Assignment-4 : Reflection of assignment 4

How ChatGPT or the tool you used assisted in this task:
I used ChatGPT to assist me in this task. It's really a cool tool for us to create something and learn something. When I have confusion about the sample questions, ChatGPT could provide me with explanations. Especially when it comes to NP-complete problems, ChatGPT could always some creative problems. All the problems it generated for me can greatly enhance my understanding to these concepts.

Challenges you faced while ensuring the problem maintained the spirit of the example:
It's a little difficult when I tried to figured out problems in the example pdf, cause they are just too abstract and contained a lot arithmetic. The basic concept is easy to understand and the basic reduction is easy to practice. However, there are too many complex problems. Sometimes in the creation of my own problems, I needed to check ChatGPT with the answers.

What you learned about problem design in the realm of algorithms:
- The most important thing that I've learned is that a well-designed algorithmic problem is clear and precisely defined. Ambiguity can lead to confusion and difficulties in understanding the problem's requirements. Therefore, it's of great essential to provide a clear and unambiguous problem statement.
- Moreover, it's also helpful to provide clear sample input and output since they clarify the problem's requirements.
- Those problems related to NP, NP-complete can really lead to practical applications.

    "Given a directed graph ` G = (V,E) `, a Hamiltonian decomposition is a set of Hamiltonian cycles such that each vertex ` v `in ` V ` belongs to exactly one cycle. In other words, a Hamiltonian decomposition of a graph ` G ` is a set of Hamiltonian cycles which are sub-graphs of ` G ` and together include all vertices of ` G `. If the cycles in the decomposition do not share any edges, the decomposition is called an edge-disjoint Hamiltonian decomposition.\n",

    "4. **Exploring Feasibility and Constraints**: Part B of the question, which asks whether a perfect matching is always possible, delves into the exploration of constraints and feasibility in optimization problems. This aspect is crucial in decision-making processes, where understanding the limits and capabilities of a system or situation is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Algorithmic Thinking and Problem Solving**: The task of expressing a real-world problem in terms of a maximum flow model demonstrates algorithmic thinking - a key skill in computer science and mathematics. It involves breaking down a problem into its fundamental components and understanding how these components interact within a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Educational Value in Applied Mathematics**: Such questions have high educational value, particularly in teaching applied mathematics and computer science. They bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, encouraging students to apply mathematical concepts to solve real-life problems."

    "1. **Construct a Flow Network**:\n",
    "   - Create a source node `S` and a sink node `T`.\n",
    "   - For each volunteer ` v_i `, create a node. Connect each volunteer node to the source node `S` with an edge of capacity 1. This represents that each volunteer can only be assigned to one day.\n",
    "   - For each day ` d_j `, create a node. Connect each day node to the sink node `T` with an edge of capacity 1. This represents that each day requires one volunteer.\n",
    "   - For each volunteer ` v_i `, and for each day ` d_j ` that they are available (i.e., ` d_j ` is not in ` T_i `), create an edge from the volunteer node to the day node with a capacity of 1. This represents the possibility of assigning volunteer ` v_i ` to day ` d_j `.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Find the Maximum Flow**:\n",
    "   - Use a maximum flow algorithm like Ford-Fulkerson to find the maximum flow in this network.\n",
    "   - The maximum flow value will be the maximum number of matches (volunteer-day assignments) you can make.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this setup, a flow of 1 through an edge from a volunteer to a day indicates that the volunteer is assigned to that day. The capacity constraints ensure that each volunteer is assigned to at most one day and each day has at most one volunteer. The maximum flow in this network is then the maximum number of such assignments you can make while respecting everyone's availability."

    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding the Problem in Graph Terms**: This problem can be modeled as a bipartite graph where one set of nodes represents the people, and the other set represents the nights. An edge connects a person to a night if the person is available to cook on that night.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Applying Hall's Marriage Theorem**: This theorem provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a perfect matching in a bipartite graph. It states that a perfect matching exists if and only if for every subset of nodes ` A ` in one partition (say, people), the number of neighbors (nights they can cook) is at least as large as the size of ` A `.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analysis**:\n",
    "   - If for any subset of people, the number of nights they are collectively available to cook is less than the number of people in the subset, then it is impossible to assign each person a unique night to cook.\n",
    "   - Conversely, if for every subset of people, the number of available nights is at least as large as the number of people in the subset, then it is possible to assign each person a unique night.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Conclusion**: All ` n ` people can be matched with one of the ` n ` nights if and only if for every subset of people, the number of nights they can collectively cook is at least as large as the number of people in the subset. Without knowing the specific availabilities of each person, we cannot guarantee that a perfect matching always exists. It depends on the specific sets of nights ` S_i ` when each person ` p_i ` is not able to cook."

    "In a collectible card game where players receive cards randomly for completing challenges. There are n distinct types of cards. After completing each challenge, a player receives one card, chosen randomly and with equal probability from the n types. What is the expected number of challenges a player must complete to collect at least one of each type of card?"

    "1. **The Nature of Randomness:** The problem highlights how randomness doesn't equate to uniform distribution of outcomes over a short period. A player might receive duplicate cards before completing the set, illustrating the unpredictable nature of random events.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Non-Linear Progression:** The expected number of challenges needed increases non-linearly as the player collects more types. It's easier to find a new card at the beginning when many types are uncollected, but it becomes progressively harder as the collection grows, demonstrating diminishing returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Harmonic Numbers:** The solution introduces the concept of Harmonic numbers, which are significant in various areas of mathematics and computer science. This problem provides a practical application for these numbers, showing their relevance in calculating expectations in random distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Applications Beyond Games:** While framed in the context of a game, the principles apply to many real-world scenarios. For instance, it could model situations in ecology (like expecting different species in samples), marketing (like collecting a variety of customer feedback), or even in computer science (like hashing algorithms and collision avoidance).\n",

    "## Solution\n",
    "To find the expected number of challenges a player must complete to collect at least one of each type of card in a set of $n$ distinct types, we can use the concept of expected value in probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is akin to the \"Coupon Collector's Problem.\" Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First Card:** The first card a player collects is always a new type, so it only takes 1 challenge to get the first new card.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Second Card:** For the second card, there are $n-1$ new types out of $n$ total types. The probability of getting a new type in each challenge is$\\frac{n-1}{n}$. The expected number of challenges to get a new card is the reciprocal of this probability, which is $\\frac{n}{n-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Third Card:** Similarly, for the third card, the probability of getting a new type is $\\frac{n-2}{n}$, and the expected number of challenges is $\\frac{n}{n-2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Continuing this Pattern:** This pattern continues until the player collects all $n$ types. For the $k$-th card, where $k$ ranges from 1 to $n$, the expected number of challenges to get a new card is $\\frac{n}{n-(k-1)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total expected number of challenges is the sum of the expected values for each of these stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\text{Expected number of challenges} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{n}{n-(k-1)} = n \\left( \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{1}{n-1} + \\frac{1}{n-2} + \\ldots + \\frac{1}{1} \\right)\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "This sum is the nth Harmonic number, denoted as $H_n$. Therefore, the formula becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\text{Expected number of challenges} = n \\times H_n\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $ H_n = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\ldots + \\frac{1}{n} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula gives us the expected number of challenges a player must complete to collect at least one of each type of card."

    "PushPush is a 2-D pushing-blocks game with the following rules:\n",
    "#### Initial Setup:\n",
    "A rectangular grid is set up with several single-cell tiles placed at various positions. A robot is also positioned on a designated cell within this grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Robot Movement:\n",
    "The robot has the capability to move to any adjacent cell, provided the cell is either vacant or contains a movable single-cell tile.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tile Sliding:\n",
    "In this version of the game, when the robot pushes an adjacent tile, the tile moves exactly one cell in the direction of the push. This differs from the traditional PushPush mechanic where the tile moves to the farthest possible extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tile Merging:\n",
    "When a tile is pushed into another tile, they merge to form a larger tile that occupies two cells. These merged tiles become immovable and cannot be traversed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goal:\n",
    "The aim of the game is to maneuver the robot to a specific target cell, which is initially inaccessible due to the placement of the tiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution Specification:\n",
    "\n",
    "- MoveRobot(x, y): Command to move the robot from its current position to the coordinates (x, y).\n",
    "- SlideTile(x, y): Command to slide a tile one cell towards the specified coordinates (x, y).\n",
    "- CheckGoal(robot): Function to determine if the robot has reached its target position.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Problem Statement:\n",
    "\"Given a particular arrangement of tiles and a robot on a rectangular grid, devise a sequence of moves that will allow the robot to reach a designated goal cell.\""

    "1. **Strategic Thinking and Planning:** The game requires players to think several steps ahead. Since tiles merge into immovable objects when pushed together, each move can significantly alter the playing field. Players must plan their moves carefully to avoid creating obstacles that could block the path to the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Spatial Reasoning:** The game is a great exercise in spatial reasoning. Players need to visualize the effects of their moves on the grid, considering how sliding tiles and merging them will change the layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Algorithmic Thinking:** From a computational perspective, this game presents an interesting problem in pathfinding and state-space search. Finding the most efficient sequence of moves to reach the goal is akin to solving a puzzle, where each move changes the state of the game board. It's a practical illustration of concepts like search algorithms, heuristics, and optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Complexity from Simple Rules:** This game is a classic example of how a set of simple rules can create a complex and challenging puzzle. The mechanics of moving the robot and sliding tiles are straightforward, but the emergent gameplay from these simple interactions can be deeply engaging and complex.\n",

In more complex setups, finding the optimal solution may require algorithmic approaches, such as depth-first search, breadth-first search, or even more advanced pathfinding algorithms like A*.\n",

    "1. `MoveRobot(1, 0)`: Move the robot to the position of Tile 1.\n",

This concept is crucial for understanding how some neural networks process and stabilize information.\n",

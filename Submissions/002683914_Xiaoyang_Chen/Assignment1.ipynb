Consider a scenario where Gallery X ranks Artist Y as its top choice and Artist Y ranks Gallery X as its top choice.

    "Explanation: In the context of the Stable Matching problem, if Gallery X ranks Artist Y as its top choice and Artist Y ranks Gallery X as its top choice, then in any stable matching, Artist Y and Gallery X must be matched together. If they weren't paired in some proposed stable matching, it implies that either Artist Y is displaying at another gallery or Gallery X is hosting another artist (or both). Given their mutual top preferences for each other, they would prefer to be matched together over their current matches. This forms a blocking pair, contradicting the definition of a stable matching. Hence, for a matching to be stable, Artist Y and Gallery X must be paired together."

When I utilize ChatGPT, it typically delivers insightful answers. However, there are moments when it stumbles over fundamental concepts, and at times, it can misconstrue descriptions leading to inaccurate conclusions. Expecting it to provide flawless answers on the first attempt might be unrealistic; often, multiple corrections are needed to fine-tune the response. I've also observed that while ChatGPT's coding abilities are commendable for simpler tasks, it tends to falter with intricate algorithms, especially when not provided with a template or reference. Therefore, it's crucial to critically assess ChatGPT's feedback and maintain an independent line of reasoning. Through this exercise, my understanding of algorithmic analysis and data structures has deepened. Moreover, I've pondered over various scenarios of stable matching and discerned how the algorithm adapts across different contexts.

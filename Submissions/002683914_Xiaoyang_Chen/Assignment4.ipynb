    "### A. (10 points) Is the Minimum Weight Path Cover problem in P? If so, prove it.   \n",
    "To determine if the Minimum Weight Path Cover problem is in P (Polynomial time), one needs to establish whether there exists an algorithm that can solve the problem in polynomial time.

    "You have recently received a special invite from Google for its latest mobile OS update, Google Lollipop. You have also been given a certain d number of invites, that you can send out to your network in google plus. Your friends who receive your invite can further send invites to any of their friends (i.e., your friend- of-friends) but their friends (your friend-of-friends) cannot send any further invites to anyone. You are faced with the following challenge: Given that your google plus network can be modelled into a graph (using some API), design an efficient algorithm that would select d people from your list of friends such that everybody in your network (friends and friend-of-friends) receive the updates. a. Show that the problem GOOGLE-L-INVITE is NP Complete. b. Would it be easier to simply conclude on the possibility (true/false) of finding such d friends rather than actually finding the list of those friends? (Hint: Visualize the problem graphically. Is it possible to reduce the problem into a known partitioning problem?)\n",

    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "You are in charge of a marketing campaign and need to select a group of influencers to maximize the reach of your product. Each influencer has a specific reach, quantified by the number of people they can influence directly and indirectly through their network.    \n",
    "You need to find the most effective group of influencers, within a budget constraint, to maximize the total reach.       \n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks:\n",
    "a. Show that the problem of finding the most effective group of influencers is NP-complete.       \n",
    "b. Discuss the implications of determining the optimal group size versus identifying the actual influencers in the group.       \n",
    "\n",
    "### Input:\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph representing the network of influencers and their connections.                \n",
    "Reach level assigned to each influencer.           \n",
    "An integer k representing the budget or size constraint for the initial group.                 \n",
    "Output:           \n",
    "a. The most effective set of k influencers that maximizes the total reach.               \n",

    "## Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. NP-Completeness:\n",
    "\n",
    "In NP: Verifying a solution (a set of influencers) is in NP, as you can quickly calculate the total reach of the selected influencers and check if it meets the criteria.         \n",
    "NP-Complete: The problem is NP-complete as it can be reduced from the \"Set Cover\" problem, which is known to be NP-complete. Each influencer 'covers' certain people in their network, and the goal is to find the smallest group of influencers that cover the entire network (or maximize reach within a budget).\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Optimal Group Size vs. Identifying Influencers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining the size of the optimal group is computationally simpler than identifying the actual influencers in the optimal set. The latter requires exploring various combinations of influencers, which is computationally expensive, especially for large networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Design:\n",
    "\n",
    "Model the network as a graph.\n",
    "Use a greedy algorithm to select influencers until the budget k is reached.\n",
    "Prioritize influencers with higher reach.\n",

    "This problem is a variant of the influence maximization problem in network analysis, where the challenge is to select a subset of nodes (influencers) to achieve maximum spread or coverage. The solution involves a combination of graph theory and algorithmic optimization, particularly dealing with NP-complete problems. The presented approach, while not guaranteed to find the absolute optimal set due to the NP-completeness of the problem, aims to provide a practical and efficient solution within the given constraints."

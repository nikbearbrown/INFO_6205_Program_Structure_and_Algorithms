Assignment 1:
Summary:
I went over all the Sample problems given in the document. Utilised ChatGPT to get more clear understanding of those problems and make a similar problem based on the sample problem while retaining the structure and essence of it. Then created solutions for the created problem utilising pseudo-code ande proof of correctness. Lastly I mentioned my learnings from the particular problem in the reflection section.

Assignment 2:
I went over all the Sample problems for assignment 2 given in the document. Utilised ChatGPT to get more clear understanding of those problems and make a similar problem based on the sample problem while retaining the structure and essence of it. Then created solutions for the created problem utilising algorithm and proof of correctness through code. Lastly I mentioned my learnings from the particular problem in the reflection section.

Assignment 3: 
Went over the sample questions and worked with topics such as Masters theorem, 01 Knapsack problem, Netfork flow theory, Bellman-Ford algorithm, Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, Preflow-Push maximum flow algorithm, Polynomial-time algorithm

        "The resulting room assignments are stable.\n",
        "Let's prove each of these properties:\n",

        "1. All people eventually get assigned:\n",
        "\n",
        "* In the modified Gale-Shapley algorithm for the Stable Roommate Problem, we start with all people as free (unmatched). In each iteration, a free person proposes to their most preferred roommate who is not currently matched. There are two possible outcomes:\n",
        "\n",
        "* If the preferred roommate is also free, they become roommates, and both are no longer free. In this case, two people are assigned in one iteration.\n",
        "* If the preferred roommate is already matched but prefers the proposing person over their current roommate, they become roommates, and the previous roommate becomes free. In this case, one person is assigned in one iteration, and another person becomes free.\n",
        "* Since in each iteration, at least one person gets assigned or becomes free, and the algorithm continues until there are no more free people, it guarantees that all people eventually get assigned.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The resulting room assignments are stable:\n",
        "\n",
        "* To prove the stability of the resulting room assignments, we'll show that no two people prefer each other over their current roommates.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exist two people, A and B, who prefer each other over their current roommates. Let's analyze the conditions under which A and B can be matched with each other:\n",
        "\n",
        "* A proposed to B and was accepted by B. This means that A prefers B over their current roommate.\n",
        "B proposed to A and was accepted by A. This means that B prefers A over their current roommate.\n",
        "However, this situation cannot occur because both A and B cannot be free at the same time in this algorithm. When A proposed to B and was accepted, it implies that B was not free but had a less preferred roommate. Similarly, when B proposed to A and was accepted, it implies that A was not free but had a less preferred roommate.\n",

        "* Therefore, the modified Gale-Shapley algorithm ensures that no instability arises in the resulting room assignments, and they are stable.\n",

The initial example involved building a wall with bricks, and translating this into a bookshelf problem required ensuring the analogous elements made sense and were logically consistent. The challenge was in preserving the underlying algorithm while replacing the brick-related terminology with book-related terms in a way that felt natural and coherent. Striking the right balance to keep the problem challenging and engaging for the reader, yet relatable to the new context, required thoughtful consideration and careful rephrasing. Additionally, ensuring that the problem maintained a similar complexity and mathematical basis while being applicable to book arrangement involved creative thinking and problem design. This process provided valuable insights into the nuances of problem adaptation and abstraction, aligning it with the core learnings from the original example.\n",

        "\n",
        "In the problem provided, we are comparing two algorithms in terms of their time complexity as a function of input size (n). The time complexity is expressed in terms of seconds required by each algorithm to solve a problem of size n.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first algorithm's time complexity is log2(n) seconds, and the second algorithm's time complexity is √n seconds.\n",
        "\n",
        "To determine which algorithm grows asymptotically faster (i.e., which one becomes more time-consuming as n increases), we compare the growth rates of the functions log2(n) and √n.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Growth Comparison:\n",
        "\n",
        " - The function log2(n) grows logarithmically with the base 2, which is slower than linear growth.\n",
        " - The function √n grows with a square root, which is slower than logarithmic growth.\n",
        " - As n gets large, the function √n will grow faster than log2(n).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Crossover Point (Intersection):\n",
        "\n",
        " - To find the crossover point where the two functions intersect (i.e., when they are equal), we need to solve the equation log2(n) = √n for n.\n",
        "WolframAlpha was used to calculate this intersection point, and it turns out to be approximately n = 16.\n",
        " - The crossover point is the value of n at which the curves representing the time complexities of the two algorithms intersect, indicating the point at which one algorithm becomes faster than the other for a given input size.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, for input sizes n greater than approximately 16, the algorithm with time complexity √n will be faster (grow asymptotically faster) than the algorithm with time complexity log2(n).\n",

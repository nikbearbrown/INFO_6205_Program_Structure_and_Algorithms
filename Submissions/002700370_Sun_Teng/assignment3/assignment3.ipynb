    "1. Polynomial-Time Algorithm:\n",
    "Create a Flow Network:\n",
    "Create a flow network that consists of a source node (S), a sink node (T), nodes representing injured individuals, and nodes representing relief centers. Connect each injured individual to the source node with an edge of capacity 1. Connect each relief center to the sink node with an edge of capacity [n/k], which represents the maximum number of patients a center can accommodate. Connect each injured individual to the relief centers they can reach within the specified time frame with an edge of capacity 1.\n",
    "Set Capacity Constraints:\n",
    "Set the capacity of edges connecting individuals to centers to 1.\n",
    "Set the capacity of edges from the source node (S) to individuals as 1.\n",
    "Set the capacity of edges from centers to the sink node (T) as [n/k].\n",
    "Run Maximum Flow Algorithm:\n",
    "Apply a maximum flow algorithm, such as Ford-Fulkerson to find the maximum flow in the network from the source node (S) to the sink node (T).\n",
    "Check Load Balancing:\n",
    "After obtaining the maximum flow, check if the flow from each center to the sink node (T) is equal to [n/k]. If this condition holds for all centers, it indicates that the load is balanced.\n",
    "Result:\n",
    "If the flow from each center to the sink node is equal to [n/k] for all centers, then it's possible to balance the load. Return \"Possible.\"\n",
    "If any center receives more patients than allowed, return \"Impossible.\"\n",
    "Time Complexity:\n",
    "The time complexity of constructing the flow network and running the maximum flow algorithm is polynomial in the number of nodes and edges in the network. Therefore, the entire algorithm is polynomial-time.\n",
    "2. Scenario:\n",
    "Suppose there are 12 injured individuals (n = 12) and 3 relief centers (k = 3). Each relief center can accommodate a maximum of 4 patients ([n/k] = 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "Injured individuals: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L\n",
    "Relief centers: X, Y, Z\n",
    "Assuming that individuals have specified reachable centers within the time frame, the algorithm is applied to the scenario. After running the algorithm, the flow from each center to the sink node is calculated and checked. If all centers receive a flow of 4, the load is balanced and it's considered \"Possible.\" If any center receives more or fewer patients, it's \"Impossible.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The result depends on the specific scenario and the connectivity of individuals to centers, but the algorithm will provide a clear answer."

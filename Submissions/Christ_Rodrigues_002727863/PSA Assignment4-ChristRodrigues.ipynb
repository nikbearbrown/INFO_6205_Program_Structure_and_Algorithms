    "Q1 (20 Points) Given a directed graph G = (V,E), a cycle-cover is a set of vertex-disjoint cycles so that each vertex v € V belongs to a cycle. In other words, a cycle cover of a graph G is a set of cycles, which are sub-graphs of G and contain all vertices of G. If the cycles of the cover have no vertices in common, the cover is called a vertex-disjoint cycle cover or simply a disjoint cycle cover. The vertex-disjoint cycle-cover problem asks whether a given directed graph has a vertex-disjoint cycle cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "A. (10 points) Is the vertex-disjoint cycle-cover problem in P? If so, prove it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "The vertex-disjoint cycle-cover problem is a known NP-complete problem, indicating that there is no known polynomial-time solution unless P equals NP. This is because it generalizes the well-known NP-complete Vertex Cover problem. The naive approach mentioned in the answer involves checking all subsets of vertices to find one that covers all edges, which is an exponential-time algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. (5 points) Suppose we require each cycle to have at most three edges. We call this the 3-cycle-cover problem. Is the 3-cycle-cover problem in NP? If so, prove it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3-Cycle Cover Problem is in NP. A certificate for a \"yes\" instance is the 3-cycle cover itself. Verifying that it is a cover can be done by inspecting that each cycle is indeed a cycle and by ensuring that each vertex is covered. The algorithm to check this is linear time, making it a polynomial-time verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "C. (10 points) Is the 3-cycle-cover problem NP-complete? If so, prove it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "To show that the 3-Cycle Cover problem is NP-complete, we can reduce it from the well-known 3-SAT problem using the same basic idea as demonstrated in class for Independent Set. By constructing gadgets for clauses and connections between conflicting literals, we create a graph representation. The runtime for this construction is quadratic, making it a polynomial-time reduction. The correctness is proven by showing that if the 3-SAT instance is satisfiable, then the graph has a 3-cycle cover, and vice versa."

    "Q2 (20 Points) The Directed Disjoint Paths Problem addresses the task of determining the existence of node-disjoint paths in a directed graph. Given a graph G and k pairs of nodes (s1, t1), (s2, t2), ..., (sk, tk), the objective is to ascertain the existence of node-disjoint paths P1, P2, ..., Pk, each connecting si to ti.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the complexity of the Directed Disjoint Paths Problem entails exploring its connection with the k disjoint shortest paths problem. When aiming to identify k pairwise disjoint paths, ensuring each path is the shortest from its source to destination introduces substantial computational challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity becomes apparent when considering the scenario with zero-length edges, converting the problem into the well-studied disjoint paths problem. In this context, the problem is solvable in polynomial time, as demonstrated by Tali Eilam-Tzoreff in the context of undirected graphs (reference: Discrete Applied Mathematics, 85(2):113-138, 1998).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the complexity escalates when the length of each edge is positive. The directed version of the 2 disjoint shortest paths problem is proven to be NP-hard by Richard M. Karp (reference: Networks, 5:45-68, 1975). This implies that even when the length of each edge can be zero, the directed 2 disjoint shortest paths problem is NP-hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the complexity persists for the general case of the k disjoint paths problem in directed graphs, particularly when k equals 2. The NP-hardness of this variant suggests significant computational challenges. Despite the difficulty, a few positive results have been identified for specific instances of the k disjoint shortest paths problem.\n",

The reduction involves mapping each element of U to a specific skill in the game development context. For each subset in Set Cover, a corresponding counselor is instantiated in the Cheapest Teacher Set scenario, equipped with skills aligned to the subset elements.\n",

    "In creating a new NP-hard problem based on a given example, ChatGPT played a crucial role in articulating the problem definition and providing relevant hints. Challenges included maintaining the core computational complexity while introducing a distinct flavor, requiring a balance between specificity and generality. The process emphasized the importance of clarity, understanding computational complexity, and leveraging existing algorithmic knowledge. Overall, the experience highlighted the nuances of problem design in the realm of algorithms, involving a delicate balance and consideration of existing paradigms."

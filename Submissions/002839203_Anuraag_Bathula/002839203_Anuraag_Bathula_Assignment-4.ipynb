    "    A library has just been constructed and its shelves need to be filled with books in time for the opening date 5 days later. There are many teams all ready to work on unboxing the books from cartons and arranging them on library shelves, but only one carton can be unpacked to a shelf in a day, as the process is prone to mixups when multiple cartons are open at the same time. There are n cartons in total, each with its own allocated shelf where all its books are to be unpacked and arranged. Is it possible to complete the preparation of the library by unpacking and arranging all books to their respective shelves in time for the opening day?

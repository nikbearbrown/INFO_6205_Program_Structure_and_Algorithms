Assignment-1 summary

This assignment helped me understand the challenges of generating correct questions using AI tools. Very often, the question made no sense or the answer was wrong, and it required my own verification to make sure it was a worthy of being put on an assignment. At the same time, I discovered a lot of interesting formats for questions that i would not have been able to come up with by myself. I did not think of creating a question based on best case  time complexity, which I could only do because ChatGPT gave  me the idea. Other than that, the assignment greatly improved my knowledge of asymptotic time complexity and helped me in increasing my coding ability due to my custom implementation of Gale Shapley. In addition, I learned how to use python and Jupyter Notebooks.

Which case of the Master Theorem applies when the recurrence relation can be expressed as T(n) = 4 * T(n/2) + n^2 * log n?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: The recurrence relation T(n) = 4 * T(n/2) + n^2 * log n falls into Case 2 of the Master Theorem.\n",
        "\n",
        "Explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "In Case 2 of the Master Theorem, the recurrence relation is of the form T(n) = a * T(n/b) + f(n), where:\n",

        "In the given recurrence, f(n) = n^2 * log n, and n^(log_2(4)) = n^2. Since log n is polynomially smaller than n^2, we have f(n) = O(n^(2 - ε)) for some ε > 0. Therefore, Case 2 of the Master Theorem applies, and the time complexity of the algorithm is T(n) = Θ(n^2).\n",

        "The limitation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm is that it cannot handle graphs with negative weight cycles. A negative weight cycle is a cycle in the graph where the sum of the weights of the edges in the cycle is negative. When such cycles exist, the Bellman-Ford algorithm cannot find a reliable shortest path because it can be trapped in an infinite loop, continuously reducing the path length by going around the negative weight cycle.\n",

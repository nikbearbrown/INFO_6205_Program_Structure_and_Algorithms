        "**Problem Statement**:\n",
        "A city has designed a new water distribution system. The system consists of reservoirs (nodes) connected with pipelines (edges). Each pipeline has a capacity indicating the maximum amount of water it can transport per hour. The city wants to ensure the maximum amount of water is transferred from the main reservoir to the city center. Using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, determine the maximum water flow from the main reservoir to the city center.\n",

        "**Input Format**:\n",
        "* N - number of reservoirs in the city (2 <= N <= 500).\n",
        "* M - number of pipelines connecting the reservoirs (1 <= M <= 10^4).\n",
        "* M lines, each containing three integers: two reservoir numbers (indicating the start and end reservoir) and the capacity of the pipeline.\n",

Summary: An Overview of Computer Science Algorithms

In this problem set, various core computer science algorithms related to graph theory are explored. These include:

1.Topological sorting: an algorithm primarily used for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). An incidence-based approach to topological sorting is presented, and how it can be implemented using O(V + E) time complexity is discussed. The algorithm will not be able to complete the sort when there are rings in the graph.

2.Prim's algorithm: classical algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree in a weighted graph.

3.Manufacturing Company's Problem: This is a practical problem that can be solved by a single-source shortest path algorithm to determine which raw material will maximize profits for the company.

4.Dijkstra's algorithm: an algorithm for finding the shortest path from one node to another in a given graph.

5.Breadth-first search: a basic algorithm for searching a graph to find the shortest path from one node to another.

6.Kruskal's algorithm: another algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree in a graph.

7.Depth-first search: another basic graph search algorithm that can be used to determine if a node is accessible from another node.

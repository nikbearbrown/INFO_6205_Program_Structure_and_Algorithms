    "\n",
    "To implement this idea, we proceed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an array R of size |V| and initialize its entries to zero, and create an initially empty queue Q.\n",
    "Let Adj denote the adjacency-list representation of G.\n",
    "We scan through all the edges in Adj, incrementing R[v] each time we see a vertex v. In a directed graph, if there's no cycle, there must be at least one vertex of out-degree 0, so we know that there is at least one entry of R that is zero.\n",
    "We scan through R a second time and for every vertex v such that R[v] = 0, we enqueue v in Q.\n",
    "Dequeue Q and mark v.\n",
    "When we mark a vertex, we do as follows: for each vertex u in Adj[v] we decrement R[u] by one.\n",
    "If any of these R[u] = 0, then enqueue u in Q.\n",
    "To prove our algorithm is correct: At each step, if there's no cycle, there must be at least one vertex with out-degree 0, so the queue is never empty, and every vertex will be enqueued and dequeued once, so we will mark all the vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a vertex u with out-degree k ≥ 1, there are k vertices v1, v2, ... vk which will appear after u in the traversal of G. Then R[u] = k, since u ∈ Adj[vi] for i = 1, ... , k vertices of G, and u will only be enqueued after all vi have already been dequeued (each dequeue decrements R[u] by one).\n",
    "\n",
    "The running time is Θ(V) to initialize R, O(1) to initialize Q, and Θ(E) to scan the edges of E and count out-degrees. The second scan of R is Θ(V). Every vertex will be enqueued and dequeued from the queue exactly once. The |E| edges are removed from the graph once (which corresponds to decrementing entries of R Θ(E) times). This gives a total running time of Θ(V) + O(1) + Θ(E) + Θ(V) + Θ(E) = Θ(V + E).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the graph is acyclic, then our algorithm will mark all vertices, and the queue will be empty at the end, indicating that the graph doesn't have any cycles.\n",

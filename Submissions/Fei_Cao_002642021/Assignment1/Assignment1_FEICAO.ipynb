This situation mirrors the \"stable roommate problem,\" which involves matching members within a single group based on their preferences, as opposed to matching between two distinct groups. While modifications like the stable roommate algorithm could potentially yield stable matches, it doesn't provide the same guarantee as the Gale-Shapley algorithm for the stable marriage problem.\n",

    "Given a directed graph G = (V,E), a cycle-cover is a set of vertex-disjoint cycles so that each vertex v € V belongs to a cycle. On other words, a cycle cover of a graph G is a set of cycles which are sub-graphs of G and contain all vertices of G. If the cycles of the cover have no vertices in common, the cover is a called vertex-disjoint cycle cover or simply a disjoint cycle cover.\n",
    "The vertex-disjoint cycle-cover problem asks whether a given directed graph has a vertex-disjoint cycle cover.\n",
    "A. (10 points) Is the vertex-disjoint cycle-cover problem in P? If so, prove it.\n",

    "C. (10 points) Is the 3-cycle-cover problem in NP-complete? If so, prove it.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Solution:\n",
    "A. No, the vertex-disjoint cycle-cover problem is not in P. It is a known NP- complete problem.\n",
    "To prove that the problem is NP-complete, we need to show that it is both in NP and NP-hard.\n",
    "First, let's show that the problem is in NP. Given a graph and a cycle cover, we can easily verify whether the cycle cover is a valid vertex-disjoint cycle cover by checking whether each vertex is covered by exactly one cycle and whether the cycles are vertex- disjoint. This verification can be done in polynomial time.\n",
    "Next, we need to show that the problem is NP-hard. To do this, we reduce a known NP- complete problem to the vertex-disjoint cycle-cover problem. We will reduce the Hamiltonian cycle problem to the vertex-disjoint cycle-cover problem.\n",
    "The Hamiltonian cycle problem asks whether a given graph has a simple cycle that visits every vertex exactly once. We will show that we can reduce this problem to the vertex- disjoint cycle-cover problem as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Given an instance of the Hamiltonian cycle problem, construct a new graph G' by adding a new vertex v and edges (v, u) for every vertex u in the original graph G.\n",
    "2.Let G'' be the graph obtained by adding a new vertex w and edges (w, v) and (w, u) for every vertex u in G.\n",
    "3.Apply the vertex-disjoint cycle-cover problem to G''.\n",
    "4.If G'' has a vertex-disjoint cycle cover, then we can construct a Hamiltonian cycle\n",
    "in G by removing the edge (w, v) and the edges (v, u) corresponding to the cycles in the cover.\n",
    "5.If G'' does not have a vertex-disjoint cycle cover, then G does not have a Hamiltonian cycle.\n",
    "The reduction can be done in polynomial time, and therefore the vertex-disjoint cycle- cover problem is NP-hard. Since we have also shown that the problem is in NP, we can conclude that the vertex-disjoint cycle-cover problem is NP-complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Yes, the 3-cycle-cover problem is in NP.\n",
    "To prove this, we can provide a polynomial time verification algorithm for a given set of cycles. The algorithm simply needs to check that each cycle has at most three edges, that every vertex is in at least one cycle, and that the cycles are vertex-disjoint.\n",
    "The verification algorithm runs in polynomial time because the number of edges in each cycle is at most three, and the number of cycles is at most the number of vertices in the graph (since each cycle must contain at least one vertex). Therefore, the total number of edges in the cycles is at most three times the number of vertices in the graph, which is polynomial.\n",
    "Therefore, we have shown that the 3-cycle-cover problem is in NP.\n",
    "To show that the 3-cycle-cover problem is NP-complete, we need to show that it is in NP and that it is NP-hard. We have already shown that it is in NP, so we only need to show that it is NP-hard.\n",
    "We can do this by reducing the 3-SAT problem to the 3-cycle-cover problem. The 3-SAT problem is a well-known NP-complete problem where we are given a Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF) with at most three literals per clause, and we need to determine if there exists an assignment of truth values to the variables such that the formula evaluates to true.\n",
    "\n",
    "C. Given an instance of 3-SAT with variables x1, x2, ..., xn and clauses C1, C2, ..., Cm, we can construct a directed graph G as follows:\n",
    "For each variable xi, we create three vertices v+i, v-i, and v0.\n",
    "For each clause Cj = (l1 ∨ l2 ∨ l3), we create three additional vertices uj, vj, and wj.\n",
    "We add the following edges to the graph:\n",
    "a. For each literal li in each clause Cj, we add an edge from the vertex corresponding to the variable of li (v+ or v-) to the vertex uj.\n",
    "b. For each pair of vertices uj and vj corresponding to a clause Cj, we add the edges (uj, vj), (vj, wj), and (wj, uj).\n",
    "Now, we claim that the given 3-SAT formula is satisfiable if and only if the constructed graph G has a 3-cycle cover.\n",
    "Suppose the 3-SAT formula is satisfiable. Then, we can construct a 3-cycle cover of G as follows:\n",
    "For each variable xi, if xi is true, we include the cycle (v+i, uj, wj), (vj, v-i, uj) for each clause Cj containing li. If xi is false, we include the cycle (v-i, uj, wj), (vj, v+i, uj) for each clause Cj containing li.\n",
    "For each clause Cj = (l1 ∨ l2 ∨ l3), we include the cycle (uj, vj, wj).\n",
    "It is easy to see that each cycle in this cover has at most three edges, and every vertex in G is included in some cycle. Moreover, the cycles corresponding to true literals in the satisfying assignment are disjoint from those corresponding to false literals, so the cover is also vertex-disjoint.\n",
    "Conversely, suppose G has a 3-cycle cover. Then, we claim that there must be a satisfying assignment for the 3-SAT formula. Suppose not. Then, for each assignment of truth values to the variables, there must be some clause that evaluates to false. Let Cj be a clause that evaluates to false under the given assignment. Then, there are at least two vertices uj and vj in the cycle corresponding to Cj, and they must be adjacent in the cycle (vj, wj, uj). But this means that the edge (uj, vj) is not covered by any cycle, which contradicts the assumption that we have a 3-cycle cover of G. Therefore, there must be a satisfying assignment for the 3-SAT formula.\n",
    "Since the reduction can be done in polynomial time, we have shown that the 3-cycle- cover problem is NP-hard. Since it is also in NP, it follows that the 3-cycle-cover problem is NP-complete.\n",

We can represent the set of people as the nodes on the left side of the graph, and the set of nights as the nodes on the right side of the graph. We connect each person node to each night node with an edge, and set the capacity of each edge to 1, meaning that each person can only cook once and each night can only be assigned one cook.\n",

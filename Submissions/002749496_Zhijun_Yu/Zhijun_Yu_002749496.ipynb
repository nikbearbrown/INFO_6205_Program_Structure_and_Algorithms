    "1. Constant and Exponential Decay: \n",
    "2023+(1/2)^n\n",
    "As n approaches positive infinity, (1/2)^n will approach zero positive, so this function becomes close to a constant function. Among all functions in the list, it grows most slowly.\n",
    "2. Nested Logarithm:\n",
    "log(log(n))\n",
    "This grows more slowly than non-nested logarithmic function. To prove it, we can first calculate the derivatives respectively. Use the chain rule to calculate the derivative of log(log(n)). Since the base of logrithm is not specified, if base is e, then derivative is 1/(nlog(n)); if base is 10, then derivative is (1/(ln10)^2)* (1/(nlog(n))). Calculate the derivative of log(n), if base is e, then derivative is 1/n; if base is 10, then derivative is (1/(nln10)). Therefore, the dominant part in each derivative to compare is (1/(nlog(n))) and 1/n. When n approaches positive infinite, since the functions are continuous on (1,+∞), the derivative value of log(log(n)) at a point approaching infinity less than that of log(n) (there can be a very little slot that log(log(n)) grows faster, but generally in most part of the domain log(n) grows faster), thus, generally log(log(n)) grows more slowly than log(n), as n approaches sufficiently large, the trend is more clear. The derivative calculation for next several comparisons will be trival.\n",
    "3. Logarithmic Functions:\n",
    "log(333n),log(n^3),(log(n))^2\n",
    "Notice that log(333n) = log(333)+log(n) = constant+log(n) is obviously Θ(log(n));\n",
    "log(n^3) = 3 * log(n) is also Θ(log(n)) but increases faster than log(333n);\n",
    "(log(n))^2 grows faster than the above two because it's log(n) is squared, when n approaches infinity, (log(n))^2 will have two positive infinity multiplying with each other, so it grows faster than log(n^3). After calculating the derivatives, we can get 2log(n)/n. Notice that there may be a little slot (when n is a small positive number) that log(n^3) grows faster, but the overall trend (when n approaches infinity) is that (log(n))^2 grows faster in the long term.\n",
    "4. Linear-Logarithmic Function:\n",
    "n/(50log(n))\n",
    "As n approaches infinity, log(n) also goes to infinity, but at a much slower rate than n itself. Therefore, the overall function n/(50log(n)) grows towards infinity as n becomes very large, albeit more slowly than a linear function would. For n/(50log(n)) and (log(n))^2, we can take the ratio and simplify: n/(50* (log(n))^3). As \n",
    "n approaches infinity, the denominator (log(n))^3 grows much slower than n. Therefore, n/(50log(n)) grows faster as n approaches infinity.\n",
    "5. Linearithmic Functions: \n",
    "nlog(n), n*(log(n))^2\n",
    "As we mentioned before, n/(50log(n)) grows slower than linear functions. In this case, n/(50log(n)) grows slower than nlog(n); obviously, nlog(n) grows slower than n*(log(n))^2 as well.\n",
    "6. Polynomial Function:\n",
    "n^2.5+n^1.1+2023\n",
    "This function is the polynomial function that grows faster than linearithmic functions. n^2.5 dominates this sum in terms of growth (power function model), and this function is Θ(n^2.5).\n",
    "7. Polynomial-Logarithmic Function:\n",
    "(n^3)* log(n)\n",
    "Obviously, this function grows faster than n^2.5+n^1.1+2023. When n approaches infinity, n^3* log(n) undoubtedly grows faster than n^2.5+n^1.1+2023 because n^3 grows much faster than n^2.5 when n approaches positive infinity, and log(n) as a factor of n^3 activates the n^3 greatly. you can also calculate the derivatives to formally prove it.\n",
    "8. Exponential Function with Log Factor: \n",
    "(3^n)* log(n)\n",
    "Since the exponential function grows faster than polynomial function, (3^n)* log(n) undoubtedly grows faster than last function which is (n^3)* log(n) when n approaches positive infinity.\n",
    "9. Exponential Functions:\n",
    "20^n+40^n\n",
    "40^n dominates this sum; this function is Θ(40^n), which grows faster than (3^n)* log(n). The rule also could be drawn by calculating and compare the derivative.\n",
    "10. Logarithmic Factorial:\n",
    "log(n!)\n",
    "Such function grows faster than any exponential function but slower than the factorial function.\n",
    "11. Factorial Function:\n",
    "n!\n",

    "Imagine a bustling city with n apartments available for rent and m families looking for a place to live (m>n). Each apartment could at most house one family, and each family could at most live in one apartment. There are more families (m) looking for apartments than there are apartments (n) available. This means that, while every apartment will be occupied, there will be families that do not get an apartment in the stable matching. Each family has ranked all the available apartments according to their preference (taking into consideration factors like location, rent, size, etc.), and similarly, each apartment owner has ranked the families based on criteria like credit score, references, etc. Your goal is to find a stable matching where no apartment owner would want to evict their current tenant family for another higher-ranked family that also ranks that apartment higher than their current residence. The challenge is two-fold: Prove that a stable matching always exists; Devise an algorithm to find such matching.\n"

    "In astronomy, constellations are formed by connecting stars in the night sky with imaginary lines, creating recognizable patterns. However, in a faraway galaxy, constellations are formed by the mutual attractions between stars. Imagine a galaxy with n stars. Each star has a list of preferences ranking other stars based on their gravitational attraction to it. Among these stars, there are two specific stars, s1 and s2, with a special relationship:s1 rank s2 as its top attraction, and s2 rank s1 as its top attraction. This mutual ranking indicates a very strong gravitational pull between these two stars. Here is a statement: For every stable constellation configuration C in this galaxy, the pair (s1, s2) will always be in C. Your task is to either prove the claim by explaining why it's true or provide a counter-example to show it's false."

They are a blocking pair with respect to the supposed stable configuration C, which contradicts the definition of C being a stable configuration.\n",

    "  In this assignment, I first read and solve the problems in the sample file myself and compare my answers with the standard solutions. In this way, I understand the essence and the core of the sample problems. Based on this, I use the Chatgpt AI to set similar questions that change the background and some unimportant constraints but preserving the spirit of the sample questions. Meanwhile, I think my problems are flexible. They are not limited to changing the problem background. They rather get to the heart of the problem and examine the important learning outcomes.\n",
    "  Chatgpt is mainly responsible for building a different background or giving some academic statement of a problem, or only giving me some ideas of setting my own problems. By asking Chatgpt to provide a new background or idea, I could always come up with a case that another topic in some domain utilizes the algorithm we learn from class. Thinking about these cases or ideas deeply, I could set up a problem preliminarily. I will solve my problem and ask the Chatgpt to analyze my problems. If the ideas of solving problems are similar, then my problem's reliability will be tested.\n",
    "  The challenge I met in maintaining the spirit of the example mainly lies in understanding some sample questions. Some sample problems tend to be complicated in terms of background, so it cost me a lot of time to understand them and get to know the essence of them. Once I understand the core of the sample questions by removing the 'background' shell, it is convenient for me to build my own question aligning the essence with those sample questions. \n",
    "  I think I really learn a lot from this assignment. In terms of problem design, I learn that a good problem design shall focus on the essence of the problem and well package the problems to be more interesting and practical. The testing of the reliability is also important. That means the problem could not only follow your personal logic, instead, it shall conform to the recognition of all students. Of course, the problem shall also be accurate and academic. When it comes to designing algorithms, I find that most times before I often use brute-force algorithms to solve problems. Since those problems are simple, I could get results without considering the time complexity. However, the computational capability is always limited when we tend to solve practical problems in our life. We need to try to either simplify the question from the problem source or optimize the algorithm structure to optimize the time complexity and the space complexity. Time complexity shall be attached great importance to to make the algorithm more practical and elegant."

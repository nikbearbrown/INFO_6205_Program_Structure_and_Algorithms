This output represents the edges that make up the minimum spanning tree of the input graph. Each line displays an edge, indicating the vertices it connects and its weight.

As illustrated in the pseudocode and Python code provided earlier, we arrange all edges in ascending order based on their weights. Sorting, in this context, takes O(E log E) time. The 'E' represents the number of edges in the graph.\n",

    "* Disjoint-Set Operations: The disjoint-set (union-find) operations come into play for cycle detection and MST construction. These operations can be expressed in terms of 'V,' which is the number of vertices in the graph. On average, they operate in nearly constant time (amortized O(1)), but in the worst case, they may take up to O(log* V) time per operation, where 'log*' represents the iterated logarithm. In practical scenarios, this factor is extremely small and doesn't significantly affect the overall time complexity.\n",

This complexity efficiently handles graphs where the number of vertices (V) is generally greater than the number of edges (E). The time complexity encompasses the sorting of edges (E log E) and the disjoint-set operations (O(V)), making it a practical choice for solving real-world graph problems."

The Aramaic song “Had gadya” from the Passover Haggadah works like this as well, as do many other songs. These songs tend to last a long time, despite having relatively short scripts. In particular, you can convey the words plus instructions for one of these songs by specifying just the new line that is added in each verse, without having to write out all the previous lines each time. (So the phrase “five golden rings” only has to be written once, even though it will appear in verses five and onward.) There’s something asymptotic that can be analyzed here. Suppose, for concreteness, that each line has a length that is bounded by a constant c, and suppose that the song, when sung out loud, runs for n words total.

Purchases at stock exchanges—what’s being bought— are one source of data with a natural ordering in time. Given a long sequence S of such events, your friends want an efficient way to detect certain “patterns” in them—for example, they may want to know if the four events buy Yahoo, buy eBay, buy Yahoo, buy Oracle occur in this sequence S, in order but not necessarily consecutively. They begin with a collection of possible events (e.g., the possible transactions) and a sequence S of n of these events. A given event may occur multiple times in S (e.g., Yahoo stock may be bought many times in a single sequence S). We will say that a sequence S’ is a subsequence of S if there is a way to delete certain of the events from S so that the remaining events, in order, are equal to the sequence S’. So, for example, the sequence of four events above is a subsequence of the sequence buy Amazon, buy Yahoo, buy eBay, buy Yahoo, buy Yahoo, buy Oracle Their goal is to be able to dream up short sequences and quickly detect whether they are subsequences of S. So this is the problem they pose to you: Give an algorithm that takes two sequences of events—S’ of length m and S of length n, each possibly containing an event more than once—and decides in time O(m + n) whether S’ is a subsequence of S.*\n",

Assignment-3 : "Summary of assignment 3" 

Completing algorithmic assignments is a challenging but rewarding experience. Using ChatGPT as a tool has greatly helped me understand complex concepts and solve complex problems. 
Through interacting with ChatGPT, I gained valuable insights into algorithms, especially in the areas of Bellman-Ford, Ford-Fulkerson, Preflow-Push, polynomial-time algorithms, and master theorems.

One of the main challenges I face is ensuring that the problems I solve maintain the spirit of the examples provided. 
It was crucial not only to replicate the solution I found, but also to gain a deep understanding of the fundamentals. 
ChatGPT played a key role in clarifying doubts and explaining complex steps. 
This was especially helpful when I studied Ford-Fulkerson algorithms, where iterative processes require a clear understanding of the remaining capacity and enhancement path. 
With detailed explanations, ChatGPT helped me grasp the nuances of the algorithm and apply it effectively to solve network traffic problems.

In addition, ChatGPT played an important role in guiding me to understand the complexity of the Master theorem. 
Understanding the time complexity of an algorithm is critical, and ChatGPT's explanation uncovers the complexity of divide-and-conquer algorithms. 
With its help, I was able to confidently analyze the time complexity of recursive algorithms and infer their efficiency.

This assignment has given me valuable experience in problem design in the field of algorithms. 
I learned that mastering the basic concepts is just as important as solving the problem itself. 
Algorithms are not just formulas to remember, they are formulas to remember. They are strategies to solve problems. 
Through the challenges and ChatGPT's guidance, I gained a deeper understanding of the algorithm's system design. 
I learned to approach problems with structured thinking, breaking them down into smaller, manageable components, and applying appropriate algorithms to solve them efficiently.

Overall, ChatGPT proved to be a valuable resource for enhancing my understanding of algorithms. 
It not only helped me overcome challenges, but also provided me with the knowledge and confidence to solve complex problems. 
This experience reinforced the importance of clear conceptual understanding and thoughtful problem design, laying a solid foundation for my future efforts in the field of algorithms.

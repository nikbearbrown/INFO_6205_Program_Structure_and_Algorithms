## Assignment-4:

### How ChatGPT or the tool you used assisted in this task
ChatGPT's ability to understand and dissect complex problems in graph theory and computational complexity was invaluable. It provided clear explanations and step-by-step guidance, particularly in breaking down NP-completeness proofs and constructing algorithmic solutions. For problems like the Q3 and Q4, ChatGPT's suggestions on reducing them from the Set Cover problem sparked ideas for solution frameworks, showcasing its strength in identifying parallels between different computational problems. The tool's capability to create a diagram for the maximum flow problem in Q5 significantly aided in visualizing the problem structure and solution approach.



### Challenges you faced while ensuring the problem maintained the spirit of the example
Like Professor Brown said, this assignment is hard and really makes me struggle. On last assignment, I was trying to generate questions based on the topic we've learned but I ended up received low score for not remaining true to the original problemâ€™s spirit. Although some times ChatGPT gives me confusion, itss responses needed refinement for accuracy or clarification. This was particularly evident in complex algorithmic reductions and proofs, where precision is crucial.


### What you learned about problem design in the realm of algorithms
The use of ChatGPT revealed the importance of interdisciplinary thinking in problem design, especially in algorithms. For example, the application of flow algorithms in Q5 showcased how algorithmic principles can be applied in varied contexts.

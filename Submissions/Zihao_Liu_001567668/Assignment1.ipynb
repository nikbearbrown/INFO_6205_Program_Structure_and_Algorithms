    "Consider the two functions $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(n) = 4n^2 + 100n + 1000$\n",
    "\n",
    "$g(n) = n^2$\n",

    "1. **Part A:** Using Big O notation, describe the upper bound of $f(n)$.\n",
    "2. **Part B:** Is $f(n) = O(g(n))$? Justify your answer.\n",
    "3. **Part C:** Given another function $(h(n) = 100n^3$, is $f(n) = O(h(n))$? Justify your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Part A:** $f(n)$ has an upper bound described by $O(n^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Part B:** Yes, because $f(n)$ has a highest degree term of $n^2$, and so does $g(n)$. Therefore, $g(n)$ is an upper bound for $f(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Part C:** Yes, $f(n) = O(h(n))$. Since $h(n) = 100n^3$, it grows at a cubic rate, which is faster than the quadratic rate at which $f(n)$ grows. So, $h(n)$ is an upper bound for $f(n)$ in terms of Big O notation, hence $f(n) = O(h(n)$.\n",

Assignment-1 :

### How ChatGPT or the tool you used assisted in this task

Question 1, 7, 9 are about big O notation. I created question 2, 3 regarding Stable matching. Question 4, 5, 6, 8 are graphs questions. I learned from ChatGPT on creating graph and how to use markdown language.
I want to emphasize how helpful ChatGPT is for helping me on Question 7. It is a tricky question because I was confused about part 3. The growth rate for cubic function should be faster than quadratic function but come with a conclusion that $h(n)$ is an upper bound of $h(n)$. ChatGPT gives me a deeper explanation regarding part 3 that $h(n)$ grows at least as fast as $f(n)$ but in this case it is faster. Because $h(n)$ will eventually outgrow the quadratic function for sufficiently large values of n, thus $h(n)$ can be considered as an upper bound for $f(n)$ in terms of Big O notation. This is really helpful for me to better understand the worst-case runtime of an algorithm.
WolframAlpha also helped me with generating a graph to show the relationship between 2 functions.


### Challenges you faced while ensuring the problem maintained the spirit of the example

Question 1 is similar to the sample homework assignment 1 question 1 because I find out this question is helpful for me to understand the order of the functions.
Other questions are related to the topics we have covered in the past 3 weeks of lecture. However, not all of them are necessarily similar to the sample question. To ensure the problem maintained the spirit of the example, I will need to make sure to review the lecture material and create similar questions we have discussed in lecture and the Youtube video. These questions are helps me to review the topics we have covered in lecture pretty well.

### What you learned about problem design in the realm of algorithms
Designing algorithm problems and coding questions for the assignment helps me to identify the learning objective for the specific topic. Using ChatGPT for designing problem is a good way to learn new knowledge.

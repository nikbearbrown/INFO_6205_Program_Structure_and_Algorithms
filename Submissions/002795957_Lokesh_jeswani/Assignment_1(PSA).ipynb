    "**Justification for Task 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "BFS is the better choice when finding the shortest path between two nodes for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Optimality:** BFS guarantees that it finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Since the graph is unweighted (each edge has the same weight), BFS will always find the shortest path.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Completeness:** BFS is also complete, meaning it will find a path if one exists. It explores all possible paths of increasing length from the starting node until it reaches the goal node.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Efficiency for Shortest Path:** While DFS can find paths, it may not guarantee the shortest path, especially in unweighted graphs. DFS might find longer paths before shorter ones, whereas BFS explores shorter paths first.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Memory Usage:** BFS typically requires more memory as it needs to keep track of all nodes at the current level before moving to the next level. However, in most practical cases, the memory usage is manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, if you want to find the shortest path from node A to node F, BFS will ensure that you find the shortest path, \n",

    "<u>Q5.</u> In a Chess Championship, there are two grandmasters, Grandmaster A and Grandmaster B. Each grandmaster has a set of chess openings and tactics in their repertoire, and they want to devise a winning strategy by selecting the best openings and tactics for each game. The performance of each grandmaster in the championship is solely based on the effectiveness of their chosen openings and tactics.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the winner of the championship, the following rules apply:\n",
    "- If Grandmaster A selects an opening/tactic for a game, Grandmaster B can choose a counteropening/counter-tactic.\n",
    "- If Grandmaster B selects an opening/tactic, Grandmaster A can choose a counteropening/counter-tactic.\n",

    "There is not always a stable pair of strategies for Grandmaster A and Grandmaster B in this scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Explanation</u>:\n",
    "\n",
    "The lack of a stable pair of strategies arises from the competitive nature of chess and the ability of each grandmaster to adjust their tactics based on the opponent's choices. Here's an explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In chess, the choice of opening and tactics is crucial to the outcome of the game.\n",
    "- Each grandmaster wants to maximize their chances of winning, and they can counter the opponent's strategy by choosing appropriate counteropenings and countertactics.\n",
    "- If Grandmaster A selects an opening/tactic, Grandmaster B can choose a counteropening/counter-tactic to gain an advantage.\n",
    "- Similarly, if Grandmaster B selects an opening/tactic, Grandmaster A can counter it to gain an advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "This competitive nature means that there is no fixed strategy that both grandmasters can adopt that will ensure a stable outcome. Each grandmaster will constantly adapt to the opponent's choices, making it impossible to find a strategy pair (S1, S2) that remains stable throughout the championship.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Conclusion</u>:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of a chess championship, there is not always a stable pair of strategies for Grandmaster A and Grandmaster B. The dynamic and competitive nature of chess openings and tactics allows each player to adjust their strategy to counter the opponent's choices, preventing the existence of a stable pair of strategies."

Each stone is placed end-to-end, and the number of stones in each row is bounded by a constant 'c.' Your goal is to create the path with a limited number of stones, at most 'n' stones, while minimizing the length of each stone, represented by a function f(n). Explain how to construct such a path, and analyze the space complexity of your method.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Answer</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct the garden path with a limited number of stones and minimize the length of each stone, we can follow the approach outlined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Determining the Number of Rows (R):**\n",
    "   - Suppose we need n stones to create the garden path.\n",
    "   - We aim to determine the number of rows (R) required to obtain n stones, with each row having a limited number of stones denoted as 'c.'\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Construction Plan:**\n",
    "   - Create a construction plan that describes how to build the garden path using paving stones.\n",
    "   - The plan will consist of rows where each row specifies the number of stones used for that row.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Building the Rows:**\n",
    "   - In the construction plan, iterate for each row (i) from 1 to R.\n",
    "   - For each row, ensure that the number of stones used does not exceed the limit 'c.'\n",
    "   - Distribute the stones as evenly as possible across the row while respecting the limit 'c.'\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Space Complexity Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Analyze the space complexity of the construction plan.\n",
    "   - The nested loops have lengths bounded by constants, ensuring that the space consumed by the loops is constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Space for Rows:**\n",
    "   - Each row in the construction plan represents the space required for the stones in that row.\n",
    "   - The space required for each row is at most 'c.'\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Total Space S:**\n",
    "   - Calculate the total space required by the construction plan (S), which is the sum of the constant space (c1) and the space for all the rows (c).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Bounding Rows with n:**\n",
    "   - Establish a relationship between the number of stones required to create the garden path (n) and the number of rows (R).\n",
    "   - Use the fact that n is at least the sum of the first R natural numbers (1 + 2 + ... + R), which can be expressed as ½ R(R - 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Bounding R in terms of n:**\n",
    "   - Manipulate the inequality to show that ½ (R-1)^2 <= n.\n",
    "   - Solve for R, yielding R <= (-1 + √(1 + 8n)) / 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Final Bound on Space S:**\n",
    "   - Plug the bound on R into the space complexity equation S to determine that F(n) (the space required for building the path) is bounded by a constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Justification:</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "The justification for this approach lies in the careful construction of the garden path using nested loops, ensuring that the space used to build each row is bounded by a constant and that the overall space complexity is constant regardless of the number of stones (n). By following this method, we achieve an efficient way to use paving stones with minimal space growth, represented by the function f(n), while creating the garden path. The final bound of a constant space complexity demonstrates that the space required for building the path is asymptotically efficient and minimizes space growth as much as possible."

Algorithms like Dijkstra's or Bellman-Ford are better suited for this purpose.\n",

    "\n",
    "The correct option is **B) Algorithm Y because it has a lower Big O notation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**Justification:**</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, the choice between Algorithm X and Algorithm Y depends on the efficiency of the algorithms for the given input size and the nature of the search. Here's why Algorithm Y (binary search) is a better choice:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Comparison of Time Complexities:** \n",
    "   - Algorithm X has a time complexity of O(n), which means it may need to check all 1 million elements in the worst case.\n",
    "   - Algorithm Y has a time complexity of O(log n), which means it divides the search space in half with each comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficiency for Large Arrays:**\n",
    "   - For a sorted array of 1 million elements, Algorithm X could potentially require up to 1 million comparisons.\n",
    "   - Algorithm Y, on the other hand, would require at most log2(1,000,000) ≈ 20 comparisons. \n",
    "   - Algorithm Y's performance is significantly better for large arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scalability:**\n",
    "   - As the size of the array grows, Algorithm Y's advantage becomes even more significant. It scales logarithmically, making it suitable for very large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Practical Considerations:** \n",
    "   - While Big O notation provides a theoretical measure of algorithm efficiency, real-world performance also depends on factors such as hardware and the specific target element.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, Algorithm Y with a time complexity of O(log n) is the better choice for searching in a sorted array of 1 million integers because it is significantly more efficient and performs far fewer comparisons compared to Algorithm X with a time complexity of O(n)."

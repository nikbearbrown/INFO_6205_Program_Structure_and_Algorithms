Assignment-3 "Summary of Assignment 2"

Question - 1

 I learned more about problem design in the realm of algorithms, specifically how to create a new problem 
 based on an example. It required understanding the core concepts and adapting them to a new scenario, all 
 while maintaining the algorithmic nature of the problem.

Question - 2

This task allowed me to design a new algorithmic problem based on the provided example. ChatGPT was 
instrumental in structuring the problem statement, input/output format, and sample inputs/outputs. It also 
helped in drafting a solution pseudocode. Challenges included ensuring that the problem maintained the spirit 
of the example while introducing new elements, such as lexicographically smallest path. This task improved my 
problem design skills and deepened my understanding of algorithmic problem-solving.

Question - 3

This task allowed me to design a new algorithmic problem based on the provided example. ChatGPT was 
instrumental in structuring the problem statement, input/output format, and sample inputs/outputs. It also 
helped in drafting a solution pseudocode. Challenges included ensuring the problem maintained the spirit of 
the example while introducing new elements, such as flow values. This task improved my problem design skills 
and deepened my understanding of algorithmic problem-solving.

Question - 4

 This task challenged me to design a new algorithmic problem based on the provided example, 
 introducing the concept of time windows. ChatGPT was invaluable in structuring the problem statement, 
 input/output format, and sample inputs/outputs. Challenges included ensuring the problem maintained the 
 spirit of the example while incorporating the new time window constraint. This task deepened my problem 
 design skills and provided a fresh perspective on algorithmic problem-solving.

 Question- 5

 This task allowed me to design a new algorithmic problem based on the provided example, involving 
 optimization and graph theory. ChatGPT helped in structuring the problem statement, input/output format, 
 and sample inputs/outputs. Challenges included maintaining the spirit of the example while adding a new 
 layer of complexity by introducing a flow network and deletion of edges. This task enhanced my problem 
 design skills and deepened my understanding of algorithms for network optimization.

 Question - 6

ChatGPT assisted in designing this problem by helping to structure the problem statement, input/output 
format, and providing examples. The tool also provided valuable insights into formulating a clear and concise 
algorithm. Challenges included maintaining the spirit of the example problem while adding a new layer of 
complexity by introducing a flow network and deletion of edges. This task enhanced problem design skills 
and deepened understanding of algorithmic problem-solving.

Question - 7

This task involved formulating a problem inspired by the provided example while maintaining the essence of 
resource allocation and constraints. ChatGPT assisted in structuring the problem statement, input/output 
format, and the design of a dynamic programming solution. Challenges included ensuring that the problem was 
well-defined and that the recurrence relation correctly captured the problem's constraints and objectives. 
This task provided a valuable experience in problem design and dynamic programming.

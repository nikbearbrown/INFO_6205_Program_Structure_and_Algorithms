Assignment-2 "Summary of Assignment 2"

Question - 1

Challenge Faced:

I had to ensure that the new problem also involves finding a shortest path in a graph but with a different 
context (directed graphs instead of undirected, and specific source and destination vertices).

Defining input and output formats: Carefully defining the input and output formats to ensure that the problem
is clear and can be easily understood.

Learning:

Creating a new algorithmic problem based on the example problem was a valuable exercise in problem design. 
It required me to think about how to modify the problem while retaining its core concept. It also reinforced 
my understanding of algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm and the importance of defining clear inputs, outputs, 
and constraints.

I learned that problem design involves creativity and attention to detail. ChatGPT assisted by 
providing guidance.

was instrumental in structuring and formulating the problem, making the process smoother and more organized.

Question - 5

Explanation of ChatGPT's Assistance and Challenges Faced:

ChatGPT was instrumental in helping me design a new problem based on the provided example. The biggest 
challenge was ensuring that the new problem maintained the spirit of the example while introducing a fresh twist. In this 
case, I decided to adapt the concept of subsequences into a problem involving integer sequences, making it 
a relevant and interesting problem in the realm of algorithms.

I learned how to abstract a real-world problem, like detecting subsequences in time-series data, into a 
more general algorithmic problem. This skill is essential for transforming practical challenges into 
algorithmic ones.

Question - 6

In this problem related to topological sorting of a directed acyclic graph (DAG): While understanding about
Running Time Analysis i understood the below:

- Initializing in_degree takes O(N) time.
- Computing the adjacency-list representation takes O(N) time.
- The loop processes each course and its prerequisites once, taking O(N) time.
- Total running time is O(N).

This problem provides a different perspective on topological sorting by applying it to a practical scenario, 
course scheduling. It emphasizes the importance of graph theory and algorithm design in solving real-world 
problems efficiently.

Question - 7

The main challenge I faced was maintaining the spirit of the example problem while making it distinct and 
interesting. I had to ensure that the problem was clear and solvable, making it a valuable exercise for

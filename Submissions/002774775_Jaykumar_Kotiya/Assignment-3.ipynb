    "You are working for a bank, and you're tasked with expanding the bank's presence along Huntington Avenue, a street with N blocks, all in a straight line. Your goal is to determine the optimal locations to open ATMs along the avenue. Each block has one possible location for an ATM, and if you open an ATM at a location, you will generate a profit of pi > 0. However, there's a constraint: no two ATMs can be opened on adjacent blocks. Your task is to find the subset of locations to open ATMs that maximizes the total profit while adhering to this adjacency constraint.\n",

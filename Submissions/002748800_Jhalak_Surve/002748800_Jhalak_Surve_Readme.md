This readme file is for the summaries of my assignments for INFO 6205 - PSA

# Assignment 1 - INFO 6205 

The assignment focused on Algorithm Question Design using ChatGPT. 
It required us to create a new algorithmic problem that aligned with the essence and structure of a provided sample problem. 
The assignment consisted of several key steps, including analyzing the sample problem, using AI tools like ChatGPT for idea generation, formulating the problem statement with clear specifications, providing a solution approach, and reflecting on the process.

Learnings from the assignment - 
- Alogorithmic Analysis
- Big O notation
- Time Complexity Analysis
- Gale Shapely Algorithm

For each Question, I have first analyzed the provided example problem. I have tried to mention: 
- the problem summary 
- the input and output formats for the problem 
- the constraints -
- the solution approach 
- what algorithmic concepts does the problem utilizes.

For each new problem that I have created, I have tried to include:
- a clear problem description 
- input and output formats 
- constraints
- Sample input and output
- Solution/ Pseudocode
- Similarities with the example problem

At last, I have included a reflection on how chatgpt helped with this assignment, what all challenges I faced and what all things I learned about algorithm design from this assignment.

# Assignment 2

This assignment was similar to assignment 1 in terms of creating new algorithmic problems based on the provided sample problems.

The only difference was that the algoithmic concepts used in this assignments were new, which are listed below:

- Graph Algorithms: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's algorithm, Minimum spanning trees(Prim's and kruskal's algorithm)
- Dynamic Programming: Knapsack problem, weighted interval problem
- Master Theorem
- Subsequence problem

The total assignment is of 100 marks, so I have created 10 different problems each carrying 10 points.

# Assignment 3

In this assignment, I learned about algorithm question design for the following algorithmic concepts:

- Graph Algorithms: Bellman Ford
- Dynamic Programming: Knapsack Problam, Weighted Interval Scheduling
- Divide and Conquer: Master Theorem and Recurrence relations
- Network Flow: Ford-Fulkerson algorithm and Preflow-Push (Pushâ€“relabel) algorithms

The total assignment is of 100 marks and I have created 6 different questions and the breakdown is as follows:

Q1. Related to Ford-Fulkerson algorithm and Preflow-Push algorithm - 15 marks
Q2. Related to Bellman Ford algorithm - 10 points
Q3. Related to Weighted Interval Scheduling and Recurrence Relation - 20 points
Q4. Related to Master Theorem - 15 points
Q5. Related to Knapsack Problem - 20 points
Q6. Related to Network Flow - 20 points

# Assignment 4

In this assignment, I learned about NP complete problems and how to prove if one problem is NP complete or not.

I have tried to follow a similar structure as that of the sample problems. There are a total of 5 questions each containing 20 points, coming to a total of 100 points.

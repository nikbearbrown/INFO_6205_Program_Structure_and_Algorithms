    "The solution employs the Bellman-Ford algorithm to analyze potential flight delays and determine critical flights that could lead to maximum overall delay in the airport's flight schedule. It starts by initializing arrays to track distances and parent flights, then iteratively relaxes edges considering potential delays. The algorithm detects negative cycles, signifying situations where certain flights, if delayed, would trigger a cascading effect causing significant overall delays. The critical flights are identified by backtracking through the parent flights within negative cycles. These critical flights are the ones most pivotal in affecting the airport's overall delay scenario, making them essential to address for efficient flight management.\n",

    "The solution addresses the \"Mysterious Sorting\" problem by employing a divide-and-conquer approach. It recursively splits the input list into smaller halves until it reaches individual elements, which are inherently sorted. Then, it merges these sorted sublists while ensuring the overall merged list remains sorted. This divide-and-conquer strategy leverages the Master Theorem to estimate the time complexity. The approach guarantees a sorted output while efficiently breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable segments. It exhibits a time complexity of O(n * log(n)), making it an effective method for sorting large datasets.\n",

The assignment focused on Algorithm Question Design using ChatGPT. 
It required us to create a new algorithmic problem that aligned with the essence and structure of a provided sample problem. 
The assignment consisted of several key steps, including analyzing the sample problem, using AI tools like ChatGPT for idea generation, formulating the problem statement with clear specifications, providing a solution approach, and reflecting on the process.

Learnings from the assignment - 
- Alogorithmic Analysis
- Big O notation
- Time Complexity Analysis
- Gale Shapely Algorithm

For each Question, I have first analyzed the provided example problem. I have tried to mention: 
- the problem summary 
- the input and output formats for the problem 
- the constraints -
- the solution approach 
- what algorithmic concepts does the problem utilizes.

For each new problem that I have created, I have tried to include:
- a clear problem description 
- input and output formats 
- constraints
- Sample input and output
- Solution/ Pseudocode
- Similarities with the example problem

At last, I have included a reflection on how chatgpt helped with this assignment, what all challenges I faced and what all things I learned about algorithm design from this assignment.

    "The solution approach uses the Gale-Shapley algorithm to match students to colleges fairly and efficiently in the College Admissions Challenge. It begins with initializing data structures and iterates through students' preference lists, assigning them to their top-choice colleges if available or reassigning when necessary. This process continues until all students are assigned, ensuring stable and preference-respecting college-student assignments.\n",

    "<strong>Similarities with the sample problem:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "The College Admissions Challenge shares similarities with the sample problem in that it employs the Gale-Shapley algorithm to achieve stable and fair assignments. Just like the stable matching of teams to play in the NBA playoffs, this problem seeks to match students to colleges based on preferences while ensuring that the matches are stable and satisfy both sides' preferences. The core algorithmic concept of using Gale-Shapley remains consistent between the two problems, emphasizing the importance of fair and stable matching in different scenarios."

    "<strong>How ChatGPT Helped:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT played a crucial role in helping me throughout the problem design process. It provided valuable guidance and ideas that helped me refine my initial problem concepts. This collaborative interaction with an AI tool proved effective in generating innovative solutions.<br><br>\n",
    "One of its significant contributions was its ability to simplify complex ideas. It aided me in breaking down the core aspects of the sample problem and identifying the fundamental algorithmic principles it encompassed. This clarity was essential for creating a new problem that retained the same essence.<br><br>\n",
    "Moreover, ChatGPT served as an educational resource. It offered explanations and directed me to relevant algorithms and data structures, enhancing my comprehension of the sample problem and the broader field of algorithms.\n",

    "<strong>Challenges Encountered:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary difficulty I faced was finding the right equilibrium between similarity and originality. While my goal was to craft a problem similar to the sample, I aimed to avoid duplication. That is why I had to do a thorough analysis of the sample problem to identify its essential components and structure.<br><br>\n",
    "Ensuring that the new problem was not overly straightforward posed another challenge. I had to guarantee that it was suitably intricate to evaluate crucial algorithmic concepts while remaining solvable within a reasonable time frame.<br><br>\n",
    "Additionally, I faced some problems with the task of presenting a clear problem statement. It was vital to communicate the problem's requirements without ambiguity, enabling participants to grasp and tackle it effectively.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Insights on Problem Design:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "Designing algorithmic problems showed me how crucial it is to be clear and precise when describing problems. If a problem is unclear, it can confuse people and make it harder to find solutions.<br><br>\n",
    "It's also important to provide solutions that are easy to understand and make sense. This means using clear pseudocode or code examples that not only solve the problem but also show how the algorithm works. These examples help people understand what's expected.<br><br>\n",
    "This experience taught me how to create problems that are different from others but still focus on the basics. It showed me the value of carefully analyzing problems and coming up with creative ideas. This way, participants can be both challenged and educated about algorithms."

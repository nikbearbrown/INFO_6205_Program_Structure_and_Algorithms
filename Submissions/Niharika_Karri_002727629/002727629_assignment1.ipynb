    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of worker teams and worker assignments, a \"stable matching\" refers to a situation where each worker is assigned to a team in such a way that no worker and team would prefer to be matched with each other over their current assignments, and there are no unstable pairs where both a worker and a team would mutually prefer each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of stability in this context is crucial because it ensures that the assignments are fair and that there are no incentives for workers or teams to break their current assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    " the key criteria that make a pair of schedules  stable in this :\n",
    "\n",
    "No Blocking Pairs: A blocking pair consists of a worker and a team who are not assigned to each other but prefer each other over their current assignments. In a stable matching, there should be no blocking pairs. This means that every worker is assigned to a team that is at least as good as their preferred choice, and every team is assigned workers who are at least as good as their preferred choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stability for All: The stability should hold for every worker and every team in the system. It's not enough to have just a few stable pairs; the entire system should be stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Illustrating with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose there are two worker teams, Team A and Team B, and two workers, Worker X and Worker Y, available for assignment.\n",

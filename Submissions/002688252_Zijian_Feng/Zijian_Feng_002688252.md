## The reflection of using ChatGPT

When I use ChatGPT, it tends to be pretty reliable. But there are times when it makes some low-level mistakes. For example, it says that 0.8^n is an exponential level of time complexity, and therefore a very rapid growth. In reality this time complexity is O(1) level. We need to pay attention to the details of his answers and not give up thinking when using ChatGPT.

## What I learned in this assignment

After doing this assignment, I have a better understanding of stable matching and time complexity. And I have also thought about the various situations of stable matching and know how the stable matching algorithm changes in different situations.

    "### Detailed Problem Description: MAX-SAT Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "The Maximum Satisfiability (MAX-SAT) Problem is a classic problem in computational complexity theory and combinatorial optimization. It is an extension of the well-known Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT), which is the first problem that was proven to be NP-complete. The SAT problem asks whether there exists an assignment to variables that makes a Boolean formula true. MAX-SAT, on the other hand, focuses on maximizing the number of satisfied clauses in a Boolean formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a Boolean formula in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), the MAX-SAT problem seeks to find an assignment to the variables that maximizes the number of satisfied clauses. A CNF formula is composed of conjunctions (ANDs) of one or more disjunctions (ORs) of literals (a variable or its negation).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formulation\n",
    "- **Input**: A Boolean formula \\( \\Phi \\) in CNF. \\( \\Phi \\) is a conjunction of \\( m \\) clauses \\( C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_m \\), where each clause is a disjunction of literals.\n",
    "- **Objective**: Find an assignment to the variables that maximizes the number of clauses in \\( \\Phi \\) that are satisfied.\n",
    "- **Output**: The maximum number of clauses that can be satisfied by any assignment.\n"

    "## Solution:\n",
    "Proving that the MAX-SAT problem is NP-complete involves two main steps: showing that it is in NP and that it is NP-hard. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Proof of NP-completeness for MAX-SAT\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. MAX-SAT is in NP\n",
    "- A problem is in NP if, given a solution, it can be verified in polynomial time.\n",
    "- In the case of MAX-SAT, given an assignment of values to variables, it is straightforward to check in polynomial time whether a clause is satisfied (just evaluate the Boolean expression for each clause).\n",
    "- Thus, verifying if a given assignment satisfies a certain number of clauses (or the maximum number) can be done in polynomial time, placing MAX-SAT in NP.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. MAX-SAT is NP-hard\n",
    "- To prove that MAX-SAT is NP-hard, we can reduce a known NP-complete problem to it. A logical choice is the SAT problem, which is known to be NP-complete.\n",
    "- **Reduction from SAT to MAX-SAT**: Given a SAT instance (a CNF formula), we use the same formula for the MAX-SAT instance. If the SAT instance is satisfiable, then the MAX-SAT solution will satisfy all clauses (making it the maximum number of satisfiable clauses). If the SAT instance is unsatisfiable, then the MAX-SAT solution will not be able to satisfy all clauses. This reduction is clearly polynomial in time as it requires no changes to the instance.\n",
    "- Since we can reduce SAT to MAX-SAT in polynomial time, and SAT is NP-complete, MAX-SAT is also NP-hard.\n",

    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "Since MAX-SAT is both in NP and NP-hard, it is NP-complete.\n",

    "**Problem: Water Distribution Network** \n",
    "You have a water distribution network with multiple reservoirs, pipes, and demand nodes. The goal is to determine if there is enough water flow in the network to meet the demands at each demand node. Each reservoir has a certain water supply capacity, and each pipe has a maximum flow capacity. The problem is to ensure that all demand nodes can be satisfied with water from the reservoirs through the pipes."

    "## Solution: \n",
    "### Network Flow Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nodes**: In our water distribution network, we have different types of nodes:\n",
    "   - Reservoir nodes (analogous to fertilizer types: mineral, organic, water-soluble, humus)\n",
    "   - Pipe nodes (representing the pipes connecting reservoirs to demand nodes)\n",
    "   - Demand nodes (corresponding to plant species: palm trees, orchids, cacti, bamboo)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Edges and Capacities**: Each pipe (edge) connecting a reservoir to a demand node has a maximum flow capacity equivalent to the amount of that fertilizer type available. The edges between demand nodes and a common reservoir represent the requirement of each plant species for that fertilizer type.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flow Conservation**: At each demand node (plant species), the incoming flow (fertilizer) from the corresponding reservoirs should satisfy the plant's requirement (one ton for each plant). The flow into a reservoir should not exceed its capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a network graph representing the problem, with nodes for reservoirs, pipes, and demand nodes, and edges representing the connections and capacities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Apply the Max Flow-Min Cut theorem to find the maximum flow from the reservoirs to the demand nodes while respecting capacity constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Check if the maximum flow satisfies the demand at each plant species (demand node). If it does, there is enough fertilizer for all the plants for a season; otherwise, there isn't enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proving Correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "The correctness of this algorithm can be proven based on the principles of network flow and the Max Flow-Min Cut theorem. The algorithm ensures that flow conservation is satisfied at each demand node, and it respects the capacity constraints of pipes and reservoirs.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying the Max Flow-Min Cut theorem, if there is a feasible flow that satisfies all demand nodes (plants) while respecting capacity constraints, the algorithm will find it. If such a flow exists, it implies there is enough fertilizer for all the plants for a season; otherwise, there isn't enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reduction to a network flow problem provides a systematic and efficient way to determine fertilizer availability for plant care, similar to how water distribution networks can be analyzed to ensure sufficient water supply."

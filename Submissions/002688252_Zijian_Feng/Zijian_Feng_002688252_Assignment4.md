## What I learned in this assignment

This assignment presented us with several challenging problems. First, we extensively explored and reasoned about whether a problem belongs to NP-complete, such as the Vertex Cover problem. In our proofs, we typically went through two steps: first, determining if it belongs to NP, and then establishing if it is NP-hard. This assignment also allowed us to revisit the Maximum Flow problem, deepening my understanding of it.

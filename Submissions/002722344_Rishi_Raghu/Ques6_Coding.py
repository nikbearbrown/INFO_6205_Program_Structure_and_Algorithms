# Example usage:

# weighted_graph = {

# graph={

# Test your code here:

# start = Some value
# end = Some value
# node = Some value
# stations = List of values

# result = shortest_path(graph, start, end)
# print("Shortest path:", result)

# result = maintenance_path(graph, node)

# print(safest_path(weighted_graph, start, end)) 

# result = min_charging_stops(graph, start, end, stations)

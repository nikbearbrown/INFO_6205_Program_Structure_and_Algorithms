## Reflection

**AI Tools I used for this assignment:**
- Chat GPT
- Bard

**Resources and refernces I used for this assignment:**

- Stanford Algorithms lectures and assignments
- VisuAlgo.net/en
- University of San Francisco Algorithms lectures and assignments( https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/)
- For definitions and use cases: Wikipedia​​, SaturnCloud​​, ScienceDirect,​Simplilearn​, Coding Ninjas​​, Programiz​​, and GeeksforGeeks​​.

### How I used the AI tools:

**- Ideation and Conceptualization:** 

Used ChatGPT and Bard to discuss real world applications where problem statements could be created for respective algorithms.

**- Adding uniqueness and complexity:**

Consulted with ChatGPT to infuse complexity and nuance into the problem statements, ensuring they were not only challenging but also pertinent to the coursework discussed in class.

**- Working on Solutions:** 

- Took help from chat-GPT and Bard to solve the rudimentary tasks of the solution and focused on discussing how modifications could be made to arrive to final solution.
- Employed a feedback loop, where solutions were reviewed for correctness by re-inputting them into ChatGPT for validation and subsequent improvement.
- Discussed the validity and robustness of the solutions with ChatGPT, particularly focusing on proof of correctness and justifications.

**- Formatting and Presentation:**
- Took help from chat-GPT and Bard to format the solutions in a readable format.(especially LaTex and Markdown)

**- Challenges Faced:**

- One significant challenge was aligning the complexity of the problem statements with the academic scope of the course.
- Striking a balance between making problems challenging yet solvable within reasonable time constraints.
- Ensuring real-world applicability of the problems without drifting away from academic objectives.

**- Learnings:**

- Realized the importance of iteratively refining problems to align them with educational outcomes.
- Learned that starting with a basic question and progressively adding complexity produces more meaningful and pedagogically valuable problems.
- Gained insights into the nuances of problem creation, understanding that a well-crafted problem tests not just theoretical knowledge but also problem-solving skills and critical thinking.

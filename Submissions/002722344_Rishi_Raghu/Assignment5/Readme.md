### How I Used the AI Tools:

**- Ideation and Conceptualization:** 

I engaged with ChatGPT and Bard to brainstorm real-world scenarios where we could develop relevant problem statements for the algorithms being studied.

**- Adding Uniqueness and Complexity:**

I collaborated with ChatGPT to enhance the complexity and relevance of the problem statements, ensuring they were challenging yet pertinent to the concepts discussed in class.

**- Working on Solutions:** 

- I used ChatGPT to verify the solutions' validity and robustness, focusing on their proof of correctness and thorough justification.
- I utilized ChatGPT and Bard to handle the foundational aspects of the solutions, allowing me to concentrate on refining them to reach the final, polished form.
- I employed a feedback loop where solutions were re-examined by ChatGPT for accuracy checks and further refinement.

**- Formatting and Presentation:**
- I sought assistance from ChatGPT and Bard for formatting the solutions, particularly for LaTex and Markdown, to enhance readability and clarity. Especially for equations and mathematical expressions.

**- Challenges Faced:**

- Striking a balance between setting challenging yet attainable tasks within reasonable time constraints.
- A significant challenge involved tailoring the complexity of problem statements to align with the academic focus of the course.
- It was important to ensure that the challenges had real-world applicability while staying focused on academic objectives.
- Integrating multidisciplinary ideas into a cohesive topic while adhering to the academic scope of the course proved challenging.

**- Learnings:**

- I learned that beginning with a basic inquiry and gradually increasing complexity leads to more relevant and educationally valuable problems.
- Focusing on the problem-solving process, rather than just the correct answer, can be more enlightening.
- Continuous refinement and adjustment of problems ensured their direct relevance to desired outcomes, such as understanding specific concepts or developing particular skills.
- I gained insights into the nuances of problem development, realizing how well-crafted challenges test not just theoretical knowledge but also problem-solving abilities and critical thinking.
- Incorporating real-world scenarios into problems helped illustrate how theoretical concepts can be applied to solve practical issues.

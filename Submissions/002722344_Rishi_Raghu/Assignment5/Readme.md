## Reflection

**AI Tools I used for this assignment:**
- Chat GPT
- Bard

**Resources and refernces I used for this assignment:**

- MIT NP Algorithms lectures and assignments

### How I used the AI tools:

**- Ideation and Conceptualization:** 

Used ChatGPT and Bard to discuss real world applications where problem statements could be created for respective algorithms.

**- Adding uniqueness and complexity:**

Consulted with ChatGPT to add complexity and nuance to the problem statements, ensuring that they were not just difficult but also relevant to the material addressed in class.

**- Working on Solutions:** 

- Discussed the solutions' validity and robustness via ChatGPT, emphasizing on proof of correctness and proper justifiation.
- Employed the help of chat-GPT and Bard to complete the primitive tasks of the solution and focused on discussing how changes could be made to arrive at the final solution.
- Used a feedback loop in which solutions were checked for accuracy by re-entering them into ChatGPT for additional checks and further improvement.

**- Formatting and Presentation:**
- Took help from chat-GPT and Bard to format the solutions in a readable format.(especially LaTex and Markdown)

**- Challenges Faced:**

- Finding an optimal balance between making tasks difficult yet solvable within appropriate time restrictions. 
- One key obstacle was matching the intricacy of the problem statements to the course's academic focus.
- Ensuring real-world application of challenges while remaining focused on academic goals.
- Integrating ideas from many disciplines into a single topic while staying within the academic boundaries of a course can be difficult. 

**- Learnings:**

- I discovered that starting with a simple inquiry and gradually adding complexity results in more relevant and pedagogically valuable problems.
- While the correct answer is vital, concentrating on the problem-solving process might be more educational.
- By constantly refining and adjusting problems, you can ensure that they are directly related to the desired outcomes, such as comprehending specific concepts or developing specific skills.
- I learned about the subtleties of problem development and how a well-crafted challenge evaluates not only theoretical knowledge but also problem-solving skills and critical thinking.
- By incorporating real-world scenarios into issues, students can gain a better understanding of how theoretical principles can be utilized to solve real-world difficulties.

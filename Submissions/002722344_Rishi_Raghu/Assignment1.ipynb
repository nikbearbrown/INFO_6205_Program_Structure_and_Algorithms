    "### **Justification and Proof of Correctness - Question 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "Proving the correctness of an algorithm generally involves demonstrating that it fulfills specific qualities or requirements that identify a \"correct\" answer. We want to prove two key features of the improved Gale-Shapley algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stability**: There should be no motivation for any student or research group to break their allocated matching to pair with each other.\n",
    "- **Feasibility**: All limitations, such as skills, stipend expectations, and grant amounts, must be met.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof of Stability\n",
    "\n",
    "For Students:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A student will submit study groups in their preferred sequence. \n",
    "- A student will never be transferred from a higher favored group to a less preferred group. \n",
    "- As a result, once matched, a student has little reason to depart from the designated group because they are in the greatest possible position.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Research Groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A group will only replace a current match if the new student is preferred. When a group is full, any replacement keeps or enhances the group's preference list.\n",
    "- As a result, a research group has no incentive to break the existing matching for a different, less desirable student.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof of Feasibility\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before making any matches, the skill sets are verified. As a result, no student is in a group who does not possess the necessary abilities. Before matching, the stipend is reviewed and taken from the group's funding, guaranteeing that the group can afford all of its matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inductive Proof of Correctess \n",
    "\n",
    "- Base Case (n=0): No one is matched when the process starts, which is a valid condition of the system. Thus it holds for n=0.\n",
    "- Inductive Hypothesis(n=k): Assuming that the procedure holds for n=k, all students and groups are stably and feasibly matched after k iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inductive Step(n=k+1): Consider iteration k+1.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If a student is matched, they are assigned to the most favored group that has not yet rejected them, for which they have the necessary abilities and may be supported by the group's remaining grant. \n",
    "    - If a group gets full or has to replace a less favored student, it replaces him or her with a more preferred one, ensuring stability.\n",
    "   - This also indicates that if the group discovered the most preferred student in the k+1 iteration, the less preferred student would have been replaced in the k iteration. As a result, the procedure works for n=k+1.\n",
    "\n",

    "### **Justification and Proof of Correctness - Question 8**\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudocode Justification and correctness proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialization Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Setting the distance between all rooms to infinity except the first, which is set to zero. This method ensures that any actual path discovered later will be shorter than infinity and will change the initialized value, making it a minimum value at that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - At the beginning, distance[start_room] equals 0 and distance[any_other_room] equals. This guarantees that the algorithm correctly determines whether or not it can improve on the initial assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Priority Queue (Q)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Priority queues guarantee that at every stage, we select the room closest to the beginning point. This is critical for effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Whenever we remove an element from the priority queue, it is always the room with the shortest distance label. This characteristic assures that we explore nodes in the order that corresponds to discovering the shortest pathways first, justifying the usage of a priority queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Check the Emergency Exit\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Finding the shortest path to the nearest emergency exit; once found, the algorithm may be safely terminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The priority queue assures that the first exit encountered has the shortest path, and no other exit has a shorter path. Stopping the algorithm when an emergency exit is reached is thus accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Impassable Rooms\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The algorithm detects and avoids inaccessible rooms, which is crucial for the evacuation's safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The algorithm only considers a room to be visited if it is not on the list of inaccessible rooms. This guarantees that impenetrable rooms never have an impact on the evacuation plan's outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Edge Relaxation and Update\n",
    "\n",
    "    - When a room is visited, the algorithm iteratively updates the distances to its neighbors, guaranteeing that the shortest path is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The method assures optimality by updating only when a shorter path is identified (new_distance distance[neighbor]). This guarantees that by the time a room is removed from the priority list, the quickest path to that room has been identified."

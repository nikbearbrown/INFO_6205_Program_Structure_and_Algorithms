**AI Tools I used for this assignment:**
- Chat GPT
- Bard

**Resources and refernces I used for this assignment:**

- Stanford Algorithms lectures and assignments
- University of Washington Algorithms lectures and assignments
- NYU Algorithms lectures and assignments
- Geeks for Geeks
- Leetcode

### How I used the AI tools:

**- Brainstorming Ideas:** 

Used ChatGPT and Bard to discuss real world applications where problem statements could be created for respective algorithms.

**- Adding uniqueness and complexity:**

Discussed what factors could be added to the problem statements to make them challenging, yet applicable and relevant to our syllabus covered in class.

**- Working on Solutions:** 

- Took help from chat-GPT and Bard to solve the rudimentary tasks of the solution and focused on discussing how modifications could be made to arrive to final solution.
- Additionally after forming the answers together, brainstormed on potential caveats in the solutionand worked upon those to refine it and arrive at efficient solutions, which handle edge case and scenarios I might have missed
- Re-fed the solutions with problem statements to Chat-GPT and Bard to test correctness of the solution and make iteration upon the code/answer.
- Used the AI tools to discuss the correctness of the solution and arrive at derivations and proofs for the same.

**- Challenges:**

- It was difficult to ensure that the new issues still corresponded to what was being taught in class.
- The difficulties have to be hard but not unreasonable to solve.
- The concerns have to feel like they were from the actual world.

**- Learnings:**

- Consider what the students should learn from addressing the challenge.
- It is critical to begin with a simple query and then go to a more sophisticated one.
- Making a good problem requires testing and feedback.
- A excellent problem evaluates not only your knowledge but also your ability to think and solve problems.

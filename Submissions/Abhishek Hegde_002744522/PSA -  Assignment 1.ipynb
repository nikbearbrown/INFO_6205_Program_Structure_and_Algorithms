    "I believe that this problem is a good example of a non-trivial problem that aligns with the essence and structure of the given example problem. The problem is similar to the given example problem in that it is an algorithmic problem that requires finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. However, the problem is also different from the given example problem in that it has a constraint on the order in which the nodes in the graph are visited. This constraint makes the problem more challenging to solve."

Using ChatGPT and based on the worked examples provided, I have tried to create new algorithemic problems, and
throghout the assignment, I have provided algorithemic problems, clear and well-structured solutions, pseduocode and codes,
code. offered logical explanations, visualization of graphs, and demonstrated a solid grasp of algorithmic concepts.
These solutions and explanations can be a valuable resource for others studying algorithms.

Concepts included:
-> Node-Disjoint Paths problem
-> Vertex-Cover problem
-> Set-Cover Problem
-> P-Np problem 
-> NP-completeness & 3-path NP
-> Node-Cover Problem
-> Knapsack problem
-> Maximum Flow problem

1. I read, used ChatGPT to deepen my understanding of the problem, tried to get it to tell me what the problem's field and nature were, and then, after figuring it out, asked him if there were any other questions that were similar. I then read and understood the problem thoroughly, came up with my own questions, and provided answers. I have tried using chatGPT to get my questions answered. I saw that chatGPT always provided me with varied replies, but I ultimately decided to stick with my responses.
2. Throughout this process, I ran across numerous issues and difficulties. First off, I frequently struggled to understand the content of the questions; for instance, I had no idea what the terms Omega and Theta meant outside of the capital O. I had to spend a lot of time using chatGPT to decipher the questions. After that, I struggled to ask inquiries of a similar nature since I lacked the necessary knowledge. The fact that chatGPT occasionally provides different responses from mine, which I believe to be incorrect, as in the case of the first question about the ranking of time complexity, is even another challenge.
3. The first lesson I've learnt is the importance of clarity; unclear queries can be challenging to comprehend. The ability to divide complicated issues into smaller, easier-to-manage issues is another talent. Then, to make the problem more rigorous, you need to add certain limitations to the design process. So that we may solve difficulties of this nature, we should be adept at comprehending the essence of algorithmic problems. The algorithm problem must also evaluate the algorithm's complexity, which is, in my opinion, the fundamental component of the algorithm.

    "If Team G adopts strategy S1 and Team H employs strategy T1, Team H would find it beneficial to shift to strategy T2, thereby securing one win instead of none. In a similar vein, when Team G applies strategy S2 and Team H remains with strategy T1, Team G would be inclined to revert to strategy S1 to clinch two victories instead of a solitary one. Consequently, these pairing tactics lack stability, constantly tempting teams to alter their strategies to maximize their wins. The provided counter-example is a clear illustration of the absence of a stable pair of strategies for the given ratings.\n",

    "#### REFLECTION:\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructing this problem spotlighted the application of the Stable Matching Problem and its principles in a novel real-world scenario: sports competition strategy. The problem underscored the fact that each stable matching is inherently tied to the preferences of all participants. Furthermore, even subtle changes to these preferences can bring about significant alterations to the matching outcome. A salient takeaway from this exercise is that it's not always feasible to discover a stable pairing, notwithstanding the stated preferences of the participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "The imaginative aspect of modifying a team's strategy and observing its ripple effect on the stability of match outcomes rendered this problem both engaging and enlightening. Moreover, this exercise accentuated that the concepts of game theory and stable match aren't exclusively the purview of computer science or mathematics. Instead, they traverse various fields, producing far-reaching implications. Overall, this endeavor was highly educational and augmented a panoramic perspective on problem-solving through the lens of the Stable Matching algorithmic principle.\n"

    "From the plot, we can observe that the execution time grows non-linearly with the size of the list. While it's not purely exponential, the growth rate is clearly faster than linear.\n",

    "This behavior is expected since the Gale-Shapley algorithm involves multiple iterations over preferences, and as the list size grows, the number of possible matchups and checks for stability increases, leading to longer execution times.\n",

    "#### REFLECTION:\n",
    "ChatGPT assisted in creating this problem by providing a similar scenario based on a different sport. One challenge was ensuring that the new problem was able to cover the same computational and algorithmic concepts as the original example. Such problems help students better understand the contexts in which these algorithms can be applied. Through this, I learned that problem design, especially in the field of algorithms can greatly influence how students understand and apply different concepts and tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also highlighted the impact of scale on computing time and resource use, a pivotal concept in algorithm design and execution. Adding practical examples like these gives students a real-world understanding where they need to consider realistic constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Opportunity for further exploration were also opened as students can now understand how even conventional matching algorithms like Gale-Shapley may not always provide feasible solutions, and adaptations and other algorithms may be needed. This is a valuable lesson in teaching students that while algorithms provide powerful tools for problem-solving, they are not always straightforward or even applicable to all scenarios.\n"

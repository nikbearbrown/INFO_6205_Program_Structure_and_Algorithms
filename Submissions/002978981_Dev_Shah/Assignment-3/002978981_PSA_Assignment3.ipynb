        "1. **Early Termination**: Consider breaking out of the loop early if no distances are updated during an iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Priority Queue**: You can optimize the algorithm by using a priority queue (e.g., a min-heap) to select the edge with the minimum distance to relax at each step. This can reduce the time complexity to O(N * log(N) + M) for sparse graphs.\n",

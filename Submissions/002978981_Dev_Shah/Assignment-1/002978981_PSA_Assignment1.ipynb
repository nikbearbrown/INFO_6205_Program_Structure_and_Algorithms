Therefore, the space complexity can be considered \\(O(n)\\).\n",

        "1. **Getting Clarity on the Example Problem:** I kicked off by diving into the example problem given. ChatGPT played the role of my \"problem interpreter.\" It helped me grasp the nitty-gritty details of the example and explained how the solution was working.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Brainstorming for a New Problem:** ChatGPT became my brainstorming buddy. We had a chat (literally!) about ideas to create a fresh algorithmic problem. The goal was to craft a problem that would capture the essence of the example provided.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Crafting the New Problem:** Armed with ChatGPT's suggestions and insights, I began crafting a new problem statement. I made sure it included all the essentials: a clear problem description, the expected input-output formats, sample cases, and the constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Coding with ChatGPT's Guidance:** Coding came next. I implemented a Python solution, and ChatGPT was right there, offering guidance and support. It provided coding tips, suggestions, and even helped me document the code properly.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Markdown Code:** To present everything neatly in a Jupyter Notebook, I used ChatGPT's assistance again. It helped me format the problem statement, code, and explanations into Markdown, making it all look clean and organized.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Reflecting on the Journey:** Lastly, I took a moment to reflect on how ChatGPT made the entire process smoother. It wasn't just a tool; it felt more like a helpful companion that made it easier for me to design a challenging problem and offered valuable support at every step.\n",

## Algorithm Analysis
In this section of the repository, you will find materials and resources related to the analysis of algorithms. This includes:

- **Big O Notation**: Explanation and examples of Big O notation, which is used to describe the upper bound on the time complexity of an algorithm.

- **Time and Space Complexity**: Discussions on time complexity, space complexity, and their analysis.

- **Asymptotic Analysis**: Exploring how algorithms behave as input size approaches infinity and how this analysis helps us compare and classify algorithms.

## Complexity Analysis
This section focuses on the analysis of algorithmic complexity. It includes:

- **Worst-case, Best-case, and Average-case Analysis**: Understanding the differences between these types of complexity analysis and when to use them.


- **Practical Examples**: Real-world examples of algorithm complexity analysis, helping you apply these concepts to actual problems.

## Stable Matching
Stable matching is a specific problem in the domain of algorithmic problems. In this section, you will find information on:

- **Stable Marriage Problem**: Explanation and implementation of the stable marriage problem, a classic problem in matching theory.

- **Applications**: Discussing real-world applications of stable matching, such as in online dating algorithms and hospital-resident matching.
